IT EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL SYNERGIES AND CHALLENGES FOR PLATFORMS TO ADD PIPELINE COMPONENTS AND VICE VERSA FOR PIPELINE BUSINESSES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER USES A CONCEPTUAL APPROACH THAT SYNTHESIZES AND INTEGRATES THE LITERATURE FROM SERVICE, HOSPITALITY, AND STRATEGY, AND SUPPLEMENTS THEM WITH TWO ILLUSTRATIVE MINI-CASE STUDIES. FINDINGS WHILE THE EXTANT LITERATURE TYPICALLY FOCUSES ON THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN INCUMBENT PIPELINE BUSINESSES THAT CREATE VALUE BY CONTROLLING A LINEAR SERIES OF ACTIVITIES AND NETWORK EFFECTS-DRIVEN PLATFORMS, WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TWO TYPES OF PLATFORM BUSINESS MODELS (I.E. PLATFORMS WITH ASSET CONTROL AND PLATFORMS WITH PEER-PROVIDED ASSETS).
