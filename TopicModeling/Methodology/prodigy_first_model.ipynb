              "\"3. Methods  3.1. Research setting, participants, and procedure  Data were collected by two sources — from two independent surveys — in the context of hotels in Macau, China. The enclave is renowned as the  “ Asian Las Vegas ”  and is currently the world gambling  capital, with a mix of international hotel chains such as Sheraton, JW  Marriott, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Conrad, Best Westin, and Holiday  Inn; as well as local and regional operators. We first identified a list of  37 hotel properties that had an adequate size of clientele and staff body,  from information provided by the local tourism authorities. These establishments were primarily casino hotels. The first survey targeted  hotel guests with an objective to assess customer dispositions and behaviors such as brand equity perceptions. For each selected property, a  quota sampling method was adopted: a quota between 20 and 50 respondents was set depending on the size of the property. Next, a group  of trained field investigators were instructed to intercept respondents at  the exit of each selected property. We used a systematic sampling  method with a skip interval of three to reduce sampling bias. A personadministered survey approach was employed to assist respondents in filling out the questionnaire. A total of 1393 subjects were recruited in  the first survey. They included 52.1% males; 36.5% between the age of  20 and 29, 28.9% between the age of 30 and 39, and 21.2% between  the age of 40 and 49; 65.0% from mainland China, 23.0% from Hong  Kong, and the rest mostly from other Asian regions.  The second survey targeted hotel employees with an objective to  assess employee perceptions and behaviors such as perceived human  resource practices, emotional exhaustion, intention to quit, and organizational tenure. Following the data collection procedure and sampling method of the first survey, a quota between 10 and 20 employees  was identified. Systematic sampling was employed with a skip interval  of three. Respondents were then intercepted at the employee exits, and  a small gift was presented to each respondent upon completion of the  survey. It is important to note that only frontline employees (i.e., line  staff and managers) working in the hotel area were recruited in the  survey, with filter questions ensuring their positions and work conditions. Both survey questionnaires were translated by two of the authors  and two independent researchers, who were bilingual, using the back  translation method. The sample of the second survey had 501 complete  responses. Of the respondents, 54.9% were females; 40.9% were between the age of 25 and 34, 33.3% were between the age of 35 and 44,  and 19.6% were between the age of 45 and 54; 57.1% had a tenure of  one to three years, while 20.8% had a tenure of three to five years; and  the majority (i.e., 78.4%) were line employees, while the rest were line  supervisors.  3.2. Measures  Scales used in the present study were all adopted from the existing  literature, as we further discuss below. These multi-item scales were  developed based on reflective measures, in that each observed variable  (i.e.,  item)  renders  a  manifestation  of  the  latent  construct  ( Diamantopoulos, Riefler, & Roth, 2008 ). Hence, the construct implied  common causality in its corresponding items.  Human resource practice . We used  Sun et al. (2007)  10-item fourfactor high-performance human resource practice scale to assess the  construct as  “ training, ” “ employment security, ” “ result-oriented appraisal, ”  and  “ participation. ”  The rating scale for each item ranged from  1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An example of the training  scale item was  “ The organization provides formal training programs to  teach new staff the skills they need to perform their job. ”  An example of  an employment security scale item was  “ The organization provides job  guarantees to employees. ”  An example of a result-oriented appraisal  scale item was  “ Employee performance is more often measured with  objective quantifiable results. ”  An example of a participation scale item  was  “ Employees are allowed to make decisions in their jobs. ”  The scale  is adequately reliable with a Cronbach's alpha ( α ) of 0.90.  Emotional exhaustion . We adopted a four-item scale from  Karatepe  and Uludag (2008)  to assess emotional exhaustion. Each item was assessed using a 9-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9  (strongly agree). Example items were  “ I feel burned out from my work ”  and  “ Working with people all day is really a strain for me. ”  The scale is  highly reliable with an  α  of 0.95.  Intention to quit . We used a four-item scale adopted from  Suazo  (2009) . Each item was evaluated using a 7-point anchor ranging from 1  (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Example items were  “ At work,  I will probably look for a job outside my current organization in the  next year ”  and  “ I often think about quitting my job. ”  The scale is fairly  consistent with an  α  of 0.91.  Brand equity . We used a four-item measure adopted from  Yoo et al.  (2000)  to assess overall brand equity. Each item was evaluated using a  5-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  An example item was  “ If there is another brand as good as this hotel, I  still prefer this hotel. ”  The scale is adequately reliable with  α  = .87.  Next we aggregated the scale at the organizational level and validated  its appropriateness. First, brand equity was significantly different  among hotels ( F  = 7.85,  p  < .001). Second, inter-member reliability indexes (ICC  = .15, ICC  = .87) and median inter-rater  agreement (r  = .85) were warranted. These evidences support  aggregation of the scale at the macro (i.e., hotel) level.  Control variables . We controlled for gender (1 =  “ male ”  and  2 =  “ female ” ), age (1 =  “ 24 or less ”  and 6 =  “ 65 or above ” ), and organization tenure (1 =  “ less than one year ”  and 4 =  “five years or  more) at the individual level. They were included in the analysis as  control variables, as commonly reported in the literature (e.g.,  Hirst,  van Knippenberg, Chen, & Sacramento, 2011 ). We further controlled  for hotel star rating (0 =  “ four star or below ”  and 1 =  “five star or  above ” ) at the organizational level. Our rationale is supported by the  fact that a hotel's brand equity and its impact could be affected by the  hotel strategy, which could be assessed by the property's star rating, as  Sun et al. (2007)  acknowledged.  Data diagnostics . Drawing on recommendations from  Podsakoff,  MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) , we addressed common method  bias (CMB) based on two approaches. First, data were collected from  two independent sources: employee and customer surveys. Second,  different scale anchors were used to mitigate CMB. We further diagnosed CMB using Harman's single-factor test. Results indicate that CMB  was not a limitation, as  χ /df = 11.14, greater than the 2.0 threshold.  The marker variable technique was also used to further assess CMB. We  used a 4-item scale of motivational climate adopted from  Moore,  Brown, and Fry (2015)  to partial out the effects of the predictors on the  criterion variable. The procedure suggests that controlling the marker  variable does not affect the proposed relationships. We diagnosed  multicollinearity using the variance inflation factor (VIF), and results  demonstrate that it was not an issue in the study, as no VIF is greater  than 2.0. \""

Measures  Scales used in the present study were all adopted from the existing  literature, as we further discuss below. These multi-item scales were  developed based on reflective measures, in that each observed variable  (i.e.,  item)  renders  a  manifestation  of  the  latent  construct  ( Diamantopoulos, Riefler, &amp; Roth, 2008 ). Hence, the construct implied  common causality in its corresponding items.  Human resource practice . We used  Sun et al. (2007)  10-item fourfactor high-performance human resource practice scale to assess the  construct as  “ training, ” “ employment security, ” “ result-oriented appraisal, ”  and  “ participation. ”  The rating scale for each item ranged from  1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An example of the training  scale item was  “ The organization provides formal training programs to  teach new staff the skills they need to perform their job. ”  An example of  an employment security scale item was  “ The organization provides job  guarantees to employees. ”  An example of a result-oriented appraisal  scale item was  “ Employee performance is more often measured with  objective quantifiable results. ”  An example of a participation scale item  was  “ Employees are allowed to make decisions in their jobs. ”  The scale  is adequately reliable with a Cronbach's alpha ( α ) of 0.90.  Emotional exhaustion . We adopted a four-item scale from  Karatepe  and Uludag (2008)  to assess emotional exhaustion. Each item was assessed using a 9-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9  (strongly agree). Example items were  “ I feel burned out from my work ”  and  “ Working with people all day is really a strain for me. ”  The scale is  highly reliable with an  α  of 0.95.  Intention to quit . We used a four-item scale adopted from  Suazo  (2009) . Each item was evaluated using a 7-point anchor ranging from 1  (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Example items were  “ At work,  I will probably look for a job outside my current organization in the  next year ”  and  “ I often think about quitting my job. ”  The scale is fairly  consistent with an  α  of 0.91.  Brand equity . We used a four-item measure adopted from  Yoo et al.  (2000)  to assess overall brand equity. Each item was evaluated using a  5-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  An example item was  “ If there is another brand as good as this hotel, I  still prefer this hotel. ”  The scale is adequately reliable with  α  = .87.

The enclave is renowned as the  “ Asian Las Vegas ”  and is currently the world gambling  capital, with a mix of international hotel chains such as Sheraton, JW  Marriott, Ritz Carlton, Four Seasons, Conrad, Best Westin, and Holiday  Inn; as well as local and regional operators. We first identified a list of  37 hotel properties that had an adequate size of clientele and staff body,  from information provided by the local tourism authorities. These establishments were primarily casino hotels. The first survey targeted  hotel guests with an objective to assess customer dispositions and behaviors such as brand equity perceptions. For each selected property, a  quota sampling method was adopted: a quota between 20 and 50 respondents was set depending on the size of the property. Next, a group  of trained field investigators were instructed to intercept respondents at  the exit of each selected property. We used a systematic sampling  method with a skip interval of three to reduce sampling bias. A personadministered survey approach was employed to assist respondents in filling out the questionnaire. A total of 1393 subjects were recruited in  the first survey. They included 52.1% males; 36.5% between the age of  20 and 29, 28.9% between the age of 30 and 39, and 21.2% between  the age of 40 and 49; 65.0% from mainland China, 23.0% from Hong  Kong, and the rest mostly from other Asian regions.  The second survey targeted hotel employees with an objective to  assess employee perceptions and behaviors such as perceived human  resource practices, emotional exhaustion, intention to quit, and organizational tenure. Following the data collection procedure and sampling method of the first survey, a quota between 10 and 20 employees  was identified. Systematic sampling was employed with a skip interval  of three. Respondents were then intercepted at the employee exits, and  a small gift was presented to each respondent upon completion of the  survey. It is important to note that only frontline employees (i.e., line  staff and managers) working in the hotel area were recruited in the  survey, with filter questions ensuring their positions and work conditions. Both survey questionnaires were translated by two of the authors  and two independent researchers, who were bilingual, using the back  translation method. The sample of the second survey had 501 complete  responses.

              " '2. Methodology  Let  e  and  s  be arrivals and departures, respectively, to/from airports and ports to/from a certain isolated region on day  t , where transit  passengers are not included. From the arrivals on day  t  it is possible to  assume that a certain proportion    are excursionists and are thereby  leaving the destination on the same day; consequently, the number of  total excursionists can be obtained as   e . Another percentage of  visitors (tourists in this case),   , will return the following day, another    will return two days later and, consequently, it is possible to consider the generic length of stay  j  and its associated percentage as   .  Obviously, it should be verified that  .  In a similar way, if we focus our attention on departures on day  t  denoted by  s , it is possible to assume that these are made up of the set  of excursionists that have arrived on the same day, which, according to  the notation mentioned above can be written as   e  plus the visitors  that arrived one day ago  e  but who are returning today   e  plus  those arriving two days ago  e  and are returning today,   e ; and  all those arriving on previous days and leaving the island on a specific  day. Thus:  (1)  It is important to note that in expression (1), parameters    are  unknown but can be econometrically estimated. In order to facilitate  this estimation it is possible to assume that most tourists stay in the  destination for a period no longer than  m , which could be one month,  two months, …and so on, such that    = 0 for all  j  >  m .  Consequently, it is possible to express the equation to be estimated  as:  (2)  where the random term  u  assumes that the relationship is an approximation. At this point, additional assumptions regarding the temporal  behavior of the parameters are needed in order to undertake the  econometric estimation. A plausible alternative would be allowing  parameters    to change periodically and, for instance, considering  that visitors arriving on a Monday have a different likelihood of being  an excursionist or of leaving the destination with a certain lag compared to visitors arriving on a Saturday. However, since the aim of the  paper is to attempt to replicate data from statistical offices obtained by  surveys, it must be admitted that this kind of information is not frequently offered by official statistics, and only mean values concerning  length of stay are shown. Consequently, if the simplest assumption regarding time-invariant parameters of Equation  (2)  is assumed, the expression to be estimated is:  (3)  At this point, it is important to note that if  s  and  e  are cointegrated,  the  u  term in the regression model (3) has to be stationary, and OLS  estimators of    are consistent. In this sense, and for the daily airport  data from Mallorca,  Haldrup, Hylleberg, Pons, and Sansó (2007)  found  evidence of cointegration between  e  and  s . Additionally, because the  estimated coefficients are interpreted as probabilities, estimation has to  be considered under the restriction of non-negative coefficients. The  estimation under inequality constrains is not straightforward (see  Judge  & Takayama, 1966 ;  Liew, 1976 ;  Wolak, 1989 ). Fortunately, there are  numerical procedures to do so. Once the parameters of the model have been obtained, and considering that    is the likelihood of leaving the destination before  j  days  of stay, the mean length of stay,  d , can be estimated from:  (4)  Since estimators of length of stay are a linear combination of  their  variances can be easily computed from the variance and covariance  matrix of the  estimators. In this sense, let  be the   vector of the  estimators, its   matrix of variances  and covariances, and let the specific   vector  a  = (1, 2, …,  m ).  Then,   and as is a linear transformation of  we get. Therefore,  approximate 95% confidence bands for  d  can be obtained as:  Finally, it should be noted that the estimation of Equation  (3)  should  be affected by multicollinearity, because arrivals on a certain day are  expected to be correlated to arrivals during the previous days. The  consequence of this correlation among the regressors should result in  coefficient estimates    changing erratically, and a high variance that  would result in non-statistical significance for many of them, or even  negative values. An alternative strategy is the initial consideration of a  general autoregressive and distributed lag model (AD) using  p  lags of  the dependent variable and  r  lags of the innovation term, but reducing  the number of lags using the general to specific strategy ( Hendry,  1995 ). Then, from the  AD ( p ,  r ):  (5)  where  ,  ,  L  is  the lag operator, so that  Ls = s , and  is white noise. Here it is possible to show how expression (5) can be rewritten in a similar way to  expression (3):  (6)  Thus, from the AD model, considering that for all  j  and that  , it is possible to obtain the mean lag (See  Hendry,  1995 , pp. 215), which in this context can be interpreted as the mean  length of stay, as:  (7)  where, for a lag polynomial  it is possible to  define:  (8) ',\n",
              " '3. Methodology  This study systematically reviewed all articles on tourist decision  making that were published in JTR, ATR, and TM between January  2008 and September 2018. Two main processes were performed before  the systematic review, namely, article collection and article screening.  3.1. Article collection  In the initial step, different sets of keywords were used to identify  articles on cognitive biases in tourist decisions. After several attempts,  the two authors agreed upon the set of {tourist, traveler, “decision  making,” cognitive, bias}.  The three journals yielded 269 articles (148, 27, and 94 articles in  JTR, ATR, and TM, respectively). The articles were then collected and  recorded in a spreadsheet to facilitate categorization and prepare for  data screening. Information regarding article titles, authors, year, affiliations, countries, and abstracts was also noted.  3.2. Article screening  All of the 269 articles were screened through two parallel actions: 1)  examining the abstract of each article and 2) inspecting the context  surrounding each of the specified keywords in the body of each article.  This process confirmed whether the article is related to cognitive biases  in tourist decisions. During the screening process, the two researchers  agreed upon the evaluative judgment by assigning each article to one of  the following categories.  Category 1: articles in which at least one cognitive bias type(s) is  explicitly stated within the body.  Category 2: articles that can be inferred as related to cognitive  biases but specify no bias type.  Category 3: articles that are not related to cognitive biases in tourist  decisions.  In this study, only Category 1 was selected for the main analysis.  The 269 articles were reviewed and coded, and the results were jointly  cross-checked to confirm the categorization. The inter-coding reliability  between the two researchers was 85%. Articles that received different  codes, particularly 1 versus 2 and 1 versus 3, were further discussed and  investigated before confirming their categorization. The last step was a  reference search, and a total of 37 articles were selected for the review. ',\n",
              " \"2. Method  2.1. Case description  A case study is needed because earthquake is highly locational  centric ( Orchiston, 2012 ;  Orchiston & Higham, 2014 ). In our research,  we choose Jiuzhai Valley as a destination of the case study. On August  8th, 2017, a 7.0-magnitude earthquake happened in the center of  Jiuzhai Valley, the world-famous tourism destination and World Heritage Site in China ( Fig. 1 ). During the earthquake, all scenic spots in  Jiuzhai Valley were damaged to a varying degree, more than 176.5  thousand residents and tourists were affected ( Yang, Xiong, Yu, & Ge,  2018 ) and the destination is still unavailable for visiting ( the  Administration of Jiuzhai Valley, 2019 ). This is the first time in China  that a World Heritage Site was directly hit by a destructive earthquake  ( The Government of Sichuan Province, 2017 ). The tourism recovery of  Jiuzhai Valley has drew the attention of central government, local  government, residents and tourists ( The Government of Sichuan  Province, 2017 ;  The Public Opinion Survey Center of Sichuan Province,  2017 ;  Yang et al., 2018 ). Because the tourism of Jiuzhai Valley is the  major source of the Jiuzhai County's fiscal income ( The Government of  Sichuan Province, 2017 ) and creates more than 60% of the regional  productive value ( Yang et al., 2018 ). What's worse, the closure of  Jiuzhai Valley will bring tourism recession to its neighboring tourism  destinations, such as the Huang Long Natural Reserve, Mianyang City  ( The Public Opinion Survey Center of Sichuan Province, 2017 ;  The  Government of Sichuan Province, 2017 ). So it's imperative to devise  and conduct some effective strategies to promote the tourism recovery  in Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake. This makes Jiuzhai Valley a good  sample for our study.  2.2. A virtual competitive market  In order to develop the simulation model, a virtual competitive  market is built ( Ma, Wen, & Yu, 2015 ). In the market, there are three  competing tourism destinations selected from Sichuan Province, China:  Jiuzhai Valley (JV), Mount Emei (ME), Mount Qingcheng & Dujiangyan  Irrigation System (QD). They are all inscribed as World Heritage Sites  by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and AAAAA Scenic Areas by the China National Tourism Administration. What's more, these destinations are the top three destinations  that tourists would like to visit in Sichuan ( The Public Opinion Survey  Center of Sichuan Province, 2017 ). So they can be regarded as having  the same level of tourism competitiveness.  These three destinations are all famous for their beautiful natural  scenery and attracting heritages. Sited in the north of Sichuan, JV is  known for multi-level waterfalls, colorful lakes and Tibetan and Qiang  tribes. ME is located in the west of Sichuan and famous for sunrise, sea  of clouds and Buddhist culture and temples. QD is close to Chengdu  City. Actually, QD consists of two sub-destinations: Mount Qingcheng  and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. Being the birthplace of Taoism,  Mount Qingcheng is known for the pleasant natural environment and  Taoism culture and temples. Dujiangyan irrigation system was built in  the 3rd century B.C. and is still performing its function. They are located closely to each other in Dujiangyan City and are listed together in  the World Heritage List. So in this study, they are regarded as one  destination.  Every year, the three tourism destinations attract millions of tourists.  Table 1  shows the tourist number and market share of the three  destinations. Due to the occurrence of the Wenchuan earthquake and its  catastrophic impacts in 2008, the tourism industry in Sichuan got back  to normal till around 2012, and the recent earthquake hitting JV happened in August 2017. Moreover, it usually takes more than one year or  years for a tourism destination to recovery from a destructive earthquake ( Huang & Min, 2002 ;  Li, Shi, & Deng, 2013 ). So the data of  tourists and market share used in this study is from 2012 to 2016 on an  annual scale, and therefore, the as date for the following tables ( Tables  2–5 ) is December 31, 2016.  2.3. Destination selection model  Theory of planned behavior (TPB) is chosen as the conceptual basis  of the model in this study. Agent-based modelling begins with the development of a conceptual framework ( Richetin et al., 2010 ). However,  most conceptual frameworks were not built on well-established psychological models of behaviors, which would make these researches in  lack of theoretical foundation and restrict the models' ability of representing the reality ( Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Sun, 2006 ). This  henomenon also exists in the tourism study with ABM (for example,  Johnson & Sieber, 2011 ;  Balbi et al., 2013 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ). TPB  is proved applicable in empirical tourism destination selection researches ( Jalilvand & Samiei, 2012 ;  Lam & Hsu, 2004 ;  Quintal, Lee, &  Soutar, 2010 ), and useful in predicting behavior in ABM ( Ceschi,  Dorofeeva, Sartori, Dickert, & Scalco, 2015 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). The essence of tourist recovery is encouraging tourists to choose the affected destination as a tourism destination ( Mair  et al., 2014 ). This makes TPB suitable for the basis of our study's destination selection model.  TPB was developed by Ajzen based on the theory of reasoned action  ( Ajzen, 1991 ): the individual's intention is a central factor to perform a  given behavior. The stronger the intention is, the more likely the performance of the behavior will happen. There are three psychological  determinants of intention, attitude toward the behavior, subjective  norm and perceived behavioral control. The greater the attitude toward  the behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control is, the  stronger an individual's attention to perform the behavior will be.  Some online data indicators or indicators based on online data are  used to measure the three psychological determinants ( Fig. 2 ). Although there are already literature coupling TPB and ABM, most of  them used questionnaires or face-to-face interviews to measure the  psychological  determinants  (for  example,  Richetin  et  al.,  2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). These self-reported data may amplify the inconsistency between intention and behavior, and constraint the predicting  ability of TPB because the individuals' psychological status changes  overtime and some other important explanatory factors are neglected  ( Lee, Mjelde, Kim, & Lee, 2014 ). Online data have been widely used to  measure the psychological status and proved effective ( Armando, José,  Gildardo, & Barker, 2017 ;  Lin, Margolin, & Wen, 2017 ). So we selected  these public online indicators to measure attitude toward the behavior,  subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. In the market, all  tourists will choose one of the three destinations to visit according to  their evaluations based on this model (it’s worth noting that the  planned behavior of tourists relying on off-line sources are not represented in the model).  2.3.1. Attitude toward the behavior  Attitude toward the behavior (AT) refers to the product of an individual's outcome evaluation of a certain behavior and the belief to  perform that behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Lam & Hsu, 2006 ). In tourism  activity, tourists' outcome evaluation mainly lies in the enjoyment that  comes from natural and cultural scenic sightseeing ( Leisen, 2001 ;  Zhang & Hui, 2016 ). The quantity and quality of scenic spots are key  factors affecting the enjoyment ( Meng, Ming, Liu, & Zhu, 2002 ;  Sun,  2006 ). Because the three destinations in this study all have attractive  but unique natural and cultural scenic spots, making it hard to measure  and compare their quality, so we use scenic spot quantity (SQ) to  measure the outcome of visiting behavior (see  Table 2 ).  Online searching has become the first approach to get information  about a destination when tourists plan a trip ( Jansen, Ciamacca, &  Spink, 2008 ;  Xiang & Gretzel, 2010 ). The stronger tourists' belief to visit  a destination is, the more information they will search for it ( Xiang &  Gretzel, 2010 ;  Zhang, Zhang, & Cui, 2018 ). So in this study the search  index data (SD) of the three destinations (see  Table 2 ), from Baidu, the  largest search engine company in China ( Yang, Pan, Evans, & Lv, 2015 ),  is used to measure the belief of the tourists. These search index data’s  unit is the online search frequency with the destination’s name, “travel  to the destination” and “tourism in the destination” as key words. For  example, for Jiuzhai Valley, the key words are “ 九寨沟 ” (Jiuzhai  Valley), “ 九寨沟旅行 ” (travel to Jiuzhai Valley) and “ 九寨沟旅游 ”  (tourism in Jiuzhai Valley).  The relation between SQ and SD is expressed as equation  (1)  with a  random sensitivity coefficient b . Because the tourists' are heterogeneous and different tourists' may have different sensitivity to the  indicators ( Mckercher, 1999 ;  Russell & Faulkner, 1999 ), so b  is  randomly assigned from 0 to 1 to every agent in the model ( Richetin  et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). “0” stands for “not sensitive at all”, “1”  stands for “highly sensitive”. In the following, b , b , b  and b  have the  same function with b .  (1)  2.3.2. Subjective norm  Subjective norm (SN) means the influence of others' opinions on the  behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Lee, Han, & Lockyer, 2012 ). Online review is the  major source of these opinions when tourists choose a tourism  destination ( Fang, Ye, Kucukusta, & Law, 2016 ;  Andrei, Svetlana, &  Juan, 2019 ). Previous studies have proved that online review can significantly affect tourists' subjective norms ( Jalilvand & Samiei, 2012 ;  Bynum, Evan, Carol, & Whitney, 2018 ). So in this study, online review  (RE) of the three destinations is used to measure the subjective norm. In  the development of conceptual framework and the simulation process  in ABM, the conclusions and data from empirical studies are useable  ( Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Ceschi et al., 2015 ).  Lai, Tang, and Zhu (2011)  collected the arrival data and online reviews of some destinations in  China, and found that the quantity and quality of online review could  affect the tourist arrivals. So, the relation between online review and  subjective norm is expressed in equations  (2) and (3) . b  is a random  sensitivity coefficient, T  is the number of each destination's total  online reviews, and N  is the number of each destination's negative  online reviews ( Lai et al., 2011 ). The constant coefficients (0.018 and  −2.73) are from the findings of  Lai et al. (2011) . The original data of  online review of the three destinations is from  Ctrip.com , the largest  travel website in China ( Table 3 ).  It's worth noting that the value of these constant coefficients (including the constant coefficients in the following equation  (5)  and  equation  (7) ) need to be adjusted according to the verification and  validation. Although the verification and validation in our study shows  that there is no need of adjustment.  (2)  (3)  2.3.3. Perceived behavioral control  Perceived behavioral control (BC) reflects the individuals' evaluation of the ease or difficulty to perform a certain behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Ceschi et al., 2015 ), which can be affected by traffic, economic and  psychological factors in tourism activity ( Lee et al., 2012 ;  Sergey &  David, 2016 ). In this study, the sum of traffic accessibility (TA), payment capacity (PC) and security level (SL) is used to measure perceived  behavioral control, which is expressed in equation  (4) . b , b  and b  are  sensitivity coefficients.  (4)  Traffic accessibility (TA) reflects tourists' perceived control on the  ease or difficulty to get to a destination ( Zhang, Zhang, & Lu, 2010 ).  Higher traffic accessibility can increase the tourists' visit intention  ( Geoffrey, Giacomo, & Richard, 2019 ). In this study, according to Hao,  Wang and Jin (2012) , traffic accessibility is calculated by the shifts of  trains, buses and planes to the three destinations. In equation  (5) , m is  the weight of every traffic mode and n is the daily average number of  shifts (here, buses are the ones directly go to the destinations). Usually,  tourists will choose a central city as a transfer station ( Dredge, 1999 )  before visiting a specific tourism destination. So in this study, Chengdu  is pointed as the transfer station. The original data of traffic accessibility is from  Ctrip.com  and official website of the three tourism destinations ( Table 4 ).  (5)  Payment capacity (PC) (comprised of income and cost) reflects  tourists' perceived control on the affordability to visit a destination ( Lee  et al., 2012 ;  Liu, Tong, & Ding, 2017 ;  Geoffrey et al., 2019 ). Income and  cost are economic factors influencing tourists' behavior ( Sparks, 2007 ;  Sparks & Pan, 2009 ). Other things being equal, higher income can increase the intention to visit a destination ( Lee et al., 2012 ) and higher  cost can decrease the intention ( Geoffrey et al., 2019 ). Here in equation  (6) , payment capacity is used to represent the effect of income and cost  ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Income means per capita disposable income, and  Hcost, T1cost and T2cost mean the average daily accommodation cost,  ticket cost and transportation cost. The initial value of per capita  disposable income is 16510 RMB, from the China State Statistics Bureau's report released in 2012. In  Table 5 , accommodation cost is the  average price of the hotels near the destinations from  Ctrip.com , ticket  cost is from the official websites of destinations; traffic cost is calculated  from the distance from Chengdu to the destinations based on the conclusions of  Zhang, Wu, Cao, and Wu (2015) . β is an alteration coefficient to simulate the variation of payment capacity ( Liu et al., 2017 ). It  is the result of per capita disposable income growth rate plus 1 every  year (INCOME) divided by tourism consumer index per year (TCPI).  From  Table 6 , the value of β is randomly assigned from 1.03 to 1.09 in  the simulation.  (6)  Security level (SL) reflects tourists' perceived control on visiting a  destination safely ( Geoffrey et al., 2019 ;  Quintal et al., 2010 ;  Sergey &  David, 2016 ). In this study, when there is no earthquake, all destinations' security level is 1.  Wang and Jia (2014)  investigated the risk  perception dynamics by utilizing online search information after three  destructive earthquakes in China. Because these three earthquakes and  the earthquake in our study all happened in Sichuan Province. So based  on their results, the security level equals (1-0.4e ) when an earthquake happens ( Wang & Jia, 2014 ). 0.4e stands for risk level, e is  the natural constant, and t is the time value.  (7)  2.3.4. Visit intention and behavior  In reality, tourists have different dependence on the attitude toward  the behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavior control ( Ceschi  et al., 2015 ;  Liu et al., 2017 ). To simulate this, three weight coefficients  (W , W  and W , W +W +W  = 1) are introduced. What's more, to  simulate the heterogeneity of tourists to the utmost extent, the value is  randomly assigned to them from 0 to 1 ( Liu et al., 2017 ;  Papadopoulos,  Baez, Alt, & Darken, 2013 ). Then the sum of the three psychological  determinants provides a behavioral intention score for tourists ( Liu  et al., 2017 ;  Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ). So, the visit intention (VI) of  tourists can be expressed as equation  (8) .  (8)  (9)  Before the actual visit behavior (VB), tourists will evaluate the three  destinations according to equation  (8) . If completely rational, tourists  will visit the destination with the highest value of VI as equation  (9)  ( Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ). Whereas in reality,  individuals usually have some inconsistency between intention and  behavior according to TPB, which is call intention-behavior gap  ( Echegaray & Hansstein, 2016 ;  Hsu & Huang, 2010 ;  Lee et al., 2014 ).  This gap may vary according to the researches' data source, model  completeness and research method ( Lee et al., 2014 ;  Willekens, 2017 ).  To simulate the gap, methods like  ε -greedy method, softmax method  and trembling hand method are introduced in ABM and proved effective ( Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ).  All these methods hold the view that, the higher the intention is, the  more likely the individual will do the corresponding behavior, but there  is still probability that behavior with smaller intention will be  erformed.  Richetin et al. (2010)  have successfully simulated the intention-behavior gap in TPB, and proved that a 5% inconsistency rate  will have the optimal outcome. So similarly, in our study, we firstly set  the inconsistency rate as 5%. This means, tourists have 95% probability  to visit the destination with the highest VI and have 5% probability to  randomly visit the other two destinations. The inconsistency rate will  be adjusted according to the following validation and verification results.  2.4. Simulation parameter initialization  2.4.1. Tourist input  Tourists are represented with agents in the model. An agent stands  for a group of tourists with similar behaviors ( Balbi et al., 2013 ). By  assigning different values of sensitivity and weight to different agents,  the heterogeneity of tourist can be simulated. Usually, the less agents  are in the model, the more fluent and quick the model runs. So, in this  study, an agent stands for 10 thousand tourists due to the calculation  ability limitation of our computer. The initial number of agents is 1153,  which is corresponding to the total tourists of JV, ME and QD in 2012.  The market growth is also taken into consideration. As showed in  Table 7 , during 2012–2016, the average market growth rate is 9.2%. So  in the simulation, since 2013, every time the model runs, the total  agents increase at the rate of 9.2% till the number of tourists exceeds  the market capacity of JV, ME or QD ( Table 8 ).  2.4.2. Normalization  Due to the difference of the data's units and scales, the original data  should be normalized into the same scale before simulation ( Chen &  Xue, 2007 ;  Kövecses & Ebrahimi, 2009 ). Here, because of the existence  of sensitivity coefficients, weight coefficients, and the comparison  among the three destinations, the original data is normalized into the  range of [0, 1] by minimization: x ’ = x /X  ( Guo, 1998 ). For example, the original data of the three destinations' attitude towards the  behavior (AD = SQ*SD) is 68880(JV), 19150(ME) and 12180 (QD),  after normalization, it becomes 1, 0.278 and 0.177. The results of  normalization are in  Table 9 .  2.5. Description of RecoverySim1.0  RecoverySim1.0 is developed to simulate the tourist recovery of  Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake. It is created on NetLogo, a powerful  and widely used platform for ABM ( Ma, Weng, & Yu, 2015 ). Because  NetLogo is “particularly well suited for modelling complex systems  developing over time” and “makes it possible to explore the connection  between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level  patterns that emerge from their interaction” ( Wilensky, 1999 ).  In RecoverySim1.0, the simulation process consists of five major  steps: (1) Agents of tourists are produced in an annual scale; (2) The  agents enter the estimation procedure to evaluate their visit intention of  the three tourism destinations one by one; (3) The judgment program  will send an agent to the destination with the highest visit intention in a  95% probability or send it to the other two destinations in a 5%  probability; (4) The number of tourists and market share of the three  destinations will be shown in the interface; (5) The data will be reset  and the simulation procedures will be repeated until the number of  tourists exceeds the tourist capacity of the destinations.  The operational interface of RecoverySim1.0 consists of one “setup”  button, one “go” button, two choosers of scenarios, six monitors of  market share and tourist number, and two plots of market share and  tourist number ( Fig. 3 ). To operate the simulation: (1) Click “EarthquakeSetting” chooser and “StrategySetting” chooser to create a scenario; (2) Click “setup” button to set the values of parameters; (3) Click  “go” button to trigger the simulation process; (4) The monitors and  plots will show the simulation results.  2.6. Verification and validation  During the development of the simulation model, several problems  or errors may arise ( Johnson & Sieber, 2011 ). Therefore it's necessary to  check to what extent the model functions as expected and reflects the  reality with some evaluations ( Johnson & Sieber, 2011 ;  Pizzitutti et al.,  2014 ). Usually there are two kinds of evaluations: verification and  validation.  Verification means ensuring building the model right, which involves the comparison of the conceptual model and the simulated one,  and evaluation of the internal consistency ( Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ;  Sargent, 2003 ). The methods for verification involve program debugging, checks of intermediate simulation output and conceptual structure test ( Kong & Wang, 2017 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ;  Sargent, 2003 ). To  verify RecoverySim1.0, we used the following methods: first, the codes  were debugged by the self-test function in NetLogo, and reviewed by  ABM experts, during which no errors were found; then, we use “turtle  monitor” tool in NetLogo to check the visit intention of the agents and  make sure not 100% but around 95% agents visit destinations with the  highest visit intention; at last, for conceptual structure test, the values  of influence factors were adjusted to different levels to check if the  output varied in the same direction. For example, when the value of  JV's security decreased from 1 to 0.5, its market share dropped from  around 32% to about 24%. The results of these kind of tests showed that  the simulation model functioned as the conceptual model.  Validation means ensuring building the right model, which requires  to check whether the simulation represents the reality ( Sargent, 2003 ).  The widely used methods for validation is checking the difference of the  simulated data to the empirical data and comparing the simulated and  the empirical data in a graph ( Balbi et al., 2013 ;  Johnson & Sieber,  2011 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ). To validate RecoverySim1.0: first, the  difference of the simulated to the empirical data is checked; second, the  simulated and the empirical data is compared in a graph. The simulation process (and the following simulations in the Result section) is  repeated ten times and the results are averaged to account for the  randomness in the simulation ( Johnson & Sieber, 2011 ).  In the difference checking progress, in order to find out the proper  inconsistency rate, we set three scenarios: 0% inconsistency rate, 5%  inconsistency rate and 10% inconsistency rate. The difference of the  simulated and the empirical market share is listed in  Table 10 . It's obvious that, with the standard deviation of the difference and the range  of the difference all being the smallest (1.14% and −2.10%–2.00%),  5% inconsistency rate makes the optimal simulation results.  What's more, in  Fig. 4 , it shows that the simulation data with a 5%  inconsistency rate well fits the empirical data, which means the simulation result well represents the reality. So RecoverySim1.0 with a 5%  inconsistency rate can be used to simulate the tourist recovery of  Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake according to the verification and  validation. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Data collection  This research studies online reviews on TripAdvisor, which is the  most well-known review platform in the tourism sector and is employed  by millions of users ( Baka, 2016 ;  Simeon et al., 2017 ). The scope of this  study is the attractions in Phuket. To select the attractions, the authors  explored travel websites that published posts about Phuket, such as  Phuket.com's  “ 15 Best Things to Do in Phuket ” , TripAdvisor's  “ Things to  Do in Phuket ” , Expedia's  “ Things to Do in Phuket 2019 ” , and Phuket101.net's  “ 18 Best Things to Do in Phuket ” . Several types of attractions were identified, including beaches, islands, Buddhist temples,  markets, a pedestrian street, shopping malls, entertainment events, and  animal sanctuaries and zoos. Large shopping malls, entertainment  events, and animal zoos and sanctuaries were excluded from the study  because they were operated mainly by the private sector; other types of  attractions were selected. The authors explored the information about  attractions in Phuket on those websites and identified 20 beaches  (25,458 reviews in total), 12 island locations (12,584 reviews), 12  markets (3,514 reviews), 2 Buddhist temples (10,519 reviews), and a  edestrian street (13,004 reviews) based on their popularity ( Table 2 ).  Reviews in English were collected in February 2019. In total, 65,079  online reviews were initially included in this research. The five categories of attractions were analysed separately.  3.2. Data pre-processing  All textual reviews contain a title and a body. To comprehensively  analyse all textual content, the authors combined the title of each review with the body. The data were pre-processed and analysed using  KNIME Analytics Platform 3.7.1. KNIME is a free open-source data  analytics platform that uses a modular pipelining concept. KNIME has  been used in previous tourism research to conduct a sentiment analysis  of airport reviews to demonstrate its compatibility ( Gitto & Mancuso,  2017 ). The research procedures are shown in  Fig. 1 . Data pre-processing begins with a punctuation eraser to remove punctuation from reviews, followed by a case converter, which changes all text to lowercase. Then, several filters are applied: first, the number filter removes  all numbers from the reviews. Second, the N Chars filter removes  reviews with less than a specific number of characters; it was set at  three in this research. Finally, the stop word filter is applied to remove  insignificant words. This study used the initial list of common English  stop words by XPO6 and included other insignificant words as well as  proper nouns such as  “ Phuket ” ,  “ Patong ” , and  “ Karon ” . In total, 65,042  reviews remained for further analysis. Next, all words were stemmed  (e.g.,  “ swims ”  and  “ swimming ”  were converted to  “ swim ” ) using an  algorithm by  Porter (1980) .  3.3. Data analysis: Latent Dirichlet allocation  To answer RQs 1 – 3, the authors conducted feature extraction, which  has been performed in several hospitality and tourism research papers  ( Schuckert et al., 2015 ). The most common method to perform feature  extraction, or topic modelling, is LDA modelling ( Guo et al., 2017 ). LDA  is a  “ generative probabilistic model of a corpus ”  that is highly e ffi cient  in managing Big Data ( Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003 ;  Tirunillai & Tellis,  2014 ). The basic idea is that the LDA model assumes the existence of a  hidden structure consisting of a set of dimensions in the whole corpus of  reviews. The model helps reveal a mixture of dimensions (also referred  to as  “ topics ” ) from an enormous number of reviews. It uses the cooccurrence of terms (or words) in reviews to infer these dimensions  ( Blei et al., 2003 ;  Guo et al., 2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ). According to  Guo  et al. (2017)  and  Tirunillai and Tellis (2014) , dimension is defined as a  latent construct distributed over a vocabulary of terms (or words) that  tourists use to describe attractions.  Fig. 2  is a graphical representation  of the three concepts.  The authors followed these six steps to complete the LDA analysis  and to answer the first three RQs:  1. Determine the number of dimensions  2. Extract the dimensions  3. Name the dimensions  4. Count the number of reviews in each dimension  5. Conduct cross-tab analysis between the dimensions and the valence  (positive and negative reviews) and calculate the difference between  expected and actual positive and negative reviews  6. Draw a chart comparing the dimensions  To determine the optimum number of dimensions for each type of  attraction, the authors used the elbow method ( Xiang et al., 2017 ). The  dimensions were extracted with the LDA algorithm; each dimension  contained 10 terms. The naming of the dimensions was performed by  one researcher followed by confirmation by another researcher ( Guo  et al., 2017 ). The number of reviews in each dimension was counted.  The proportion of a dimension's number of reviews to the attractions'  total number of reviews is regarded as the salience of that dimension,  which is used in a subsequent analysis.  To determine the valence of the reviews, this study used the description from the o ffi cial TripAdvisor website, which states that 5  points is excellent, whereas 3 points is average. The authors grouped 4and 5-point reviews as positive and 3-point reviews and below as negative. This categorisation scheme was previously created in a study by  Taecharungroj (2019) .  To assess the valence of each dimension, a cross-tabulation analysis  between the valence and the dimension of the reviews was conducted.  The cross-tabulation analysis showed the expected numbers and the  observed numbers of positive and negative reviews of each dimension.  The valence of the dimensions is the difference between the observed  and expected numbers divided by the total number of reviews in that  dimension.  Finally, a chart of each type of attraction was created to illustrate  the salience and the valence of the dimensions. The charts are called the  dimensional salience-valence analysis (DSVA).  3.4. Data analysis: Naïve Bayes algorithm  The naïve Bayes algorithm is a potent tool for sentiment analysis  because of its successful application in past research ( Geetha et al.,  2017 ;  Schuckert et al., 2015 ;  Zhang, Ye, Zhang, & Li, 2011 ). It is a  popular algorithm for document classification:  “ the algorithm computes  the posterior probability that the document belongs to different classes  and assigns it to the class with the highest posterior probability ”  ( Tan &  Zhang, 2008 ). In short, it computes the probability that a particular  review is positive or negative based on its combination of terms. In  addition to its prediction, the naïve Bayes algorithm in KNIME Analytics is valuable in indicating the average number of times a term is  present in a positive or negative review. These data are the building  blocks of the valence analysis of terms in the current research. To  conduct the naïve Bayes algorithm and analyse the terms, the authors  followed these steps:  1. Create bag-of-words and count the frequency of terms  2. Filter out infrequent terms  3. Conduct the naïve Bayes algorithm on the partitioned data (repeat  step 2 if accuracy is lower than 70%)  4. Select the terms found in the identified dimensions (from LDA)  5. Compute the valence of the terms  6. Draw a bubble chart of the terms using valence, salience, and  standardised weight  To conduct naïve Bayes modelling, the reviews were converted into  “ bag-of-words ” , whereby the order of words in the reviews is neglected.  The frequencies of all terms were counted; infrequently found terms  were removed from the analysis. Then, all reviews were randomly  partitioned into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Review classi- fication in hospitality and tourism research often achieves 70% accuracy ( Schuckert et al., 2015 ). Therefore, the current research iterated  term filtering until the accuracy was higher than 70% to ensure that all  the terms used in this analysis contributed to tourist sentiments. The  prediction accuracy was used to answer RQ5.  To analyse the valence and salience of the terms and answer RQ4,  the authors selected terms present in the dimensions identified by LDA  modelling. The valence of the terms was computed by the following  formula:  where POS is the average number of times the term is present in a  positive review, and NEG is the average number of times the term is  present in a negative review. Based on this formula, the valence of the  term in the current study refers to the difference between the average  number of times the term is present in positive and negative reviews  divided by the sum of the average number of times the term is present  in positive and negative reviews. The more positive the valence, the  more the term is present in positive reviews. In contrast, a high negative  valence means that the term is more frequently found in negative reviews.  To compare the valence and salience of terms, the lexical saliencevalence analysis (LSVA) bubble charts were drawn. The salience of the  term is computed by the logarithm to base 10 function of the frequency  of each term. Due to the left skewness of the distribution of term frequencies, the logarithm function provides clarity in the charts by reducing the outlying terms. The sizes of the bubbles are the standardised  weight of each term in its corresponding dimension. A larger bubble  means the term is more relevant to that dimension. \",\n",
              " 'theoretical or applied research.  Finally, we develop all models in a Bayesian framework as the  traditional sampling – theory estimators are more problematic to  compute and they may behave erratically in finite samples. With dynamic panel data models with random coefficients, in particular, the  use of sampling-theory estimators is prohibited as the widely used  Arellano-Bond Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) estimator assumes fixed slope coefficients. As stated by  Assaf and Tsionas (2019 , p.  273), “this is an important handicap which limits the scope of samplingtheory estimators in dynamic panel data models. Bayesian procedures  are more straightforward to apply in dynamic models as lagged dependent variables do not create new problems in terms of estimation for  the Bayesian approach”. Besides, use of the Arellano-Bond GMM estimator is problematic when the Arellano-Bond instruments are weak –in  which case the sampling behavior of GMM can be erratic and unreliable. The standard criticism against the Bayesian approach in this  context (namely that random parameters are orthogonal to the regressors) can be alleviated through the use of the Mundlak device. Use  of this device in the context of dynamic panel data is, however, novel  and constitutes a major contribution of the present paper. ',\n",
              " \"4. Methods  From a post-positivist standpoint, in-depth-interviews were conducted to explore the research phenomena and guide the design of the  subsequent experimental study.  4.1. Study 1: exploratory interviews  In line with prior tourism research on resorts ( Carr, 1999 ), ten indepth interviews were conducted with females (aged between 18 and  24 years), who had chosen either a burkini (five in-depth interviews) or  a bikini swimsuit (five in-depth interviews) and had travelled to a  coastal resort in the last six months. The interviewing process followed  the principle of theoretical saturation ( Draucker, Martsolf, Ross, &  Rusk, 2007 ) and was fully recorded and transcribed. Thematic analysis  was used to gain insights into the phenomena and aid in developing the  written scenario of the experiment. The interview guide covered  questions on interviewees' last travel experience and their motives for  referring certain swimsuits and then they answered questions about  their perceptions and behaviours in response to the presence of unknown customers.  The interviews revealed that the reasons for preferring a specific  type of swimsuit included complying with general social/cultural  norms and trying to have or avoid extensive tanning. One's relative  satisfaction with body image may turn one's burkini into a “hiding suit”  that protects one's self-esteem from looking unhealthy on the beach. In  contrast, bikinis enable females to compete to be the one with the most  attractive body.  4.1.1. Intolerance to differences in appearance  Negative reactions to different swimsuits emerged from the interviews not only for out-groups (i.e. unknown customers) but also for ingroups (e.g. companions). A nineteen-year-old female indicated that  her friends prefer to wear bikinis, though she does not. She thinks that  the “burkini gives her personal assurance and a feeling of safety.” For  unknown customers, interviews consistently demonstrated that differences in swimsuits may cause stress and discomfort.  “It was uncomfortable to see everyone in their bikinis when I am the  only one wearing a burkini. I felt like a black sheep … I stayed at the  corner of the pool for 15 minutes and then left.” (24 years, burkini  wearer)  The qualitative interviews revealed that negative glances are received from others who wear different swimsuits, due to jealousy.  “I prefer bikini but sometimes … other females who wear a burkini  may stare at me, especially if they are sitting beside their husbands,  making me totally uncomfortable … So I may decide not to swim, go  to a different beach or wait till everyone else has gone” (23 years,  bikini wearer)  Similarity in swimsuits seems to be an important issue in determining beach/resort preferences. Other respondents seem tolerant of  other customers who dress differently, but this was confined to the  authenticity and attractiveness of their burkinis.  “I am okay with the burkini, but I am not okay with those who swim  in their own clothes. There are many fashionable good-looking  burkinis!” (21 years, bikini wearer)  “I dislike girls who wear swimsuits that look like burkinis” (22  years, bikini wearer).  Attractive appearance is an important aspect of indirect customerto-customer interaction ( Brocato et al., 2012 ), even when this acknowledges a difference. Similar incidents were reported by the press in  Dubai when tourists became angry because of a female who was  wearing a non-traditional burkini (i.e. one that did not fit the body)  ( Young, 2017 ).  4.1.2. Tolerance of the elderly  Most of the interviewees were consistent in claiming that they do  not have a problem with elderly unknown people.  “My mother and grandmother are my friends. So I can relate to other  ladies of their age. I can happily engage in a conversation with  strangers, regardless of their age” (23 years, burkini wearer).  The greater tolerance of one's elders seems to be an integral part of  the collectivistic nature of the Egyptian population ( Buda & ElsayedElkhouly, 1998 ), where members of extended families may live together. This contrasts with the findings of prior studies that young  customers always feel intolerant in the presence of the elderly (e.g.  Thakor et al., 2008 ).  4.1.3. Other aspects of similarity  The interviews revealed that perceptions of similarity to unknown  others on the beach may also extend beyond age and the type of  swimsuit and incorporate other visible aspects, such as piercing as well  as non-visible aspects (e.g. personality), which may act as social clues to  determine whether they are compatible.  “On the beach, I talk to others who  look  and  talk  like me … it is a  personality thing … piercing may stop me from interacting with  someone I don't know because I hate it” (22 years, bikini wearer).  4.2. Study 2: experimental design  Most of tourism studies have adapted descriptive (e.g.  Hwang &  Han, 2017 ) or exploratory research (e.g.  Papathanassis, 2012 ) approaches to examine customer-to-customer interactions. In this endeavour, causal research has been underused (e.g.  Choi & Mattila,  2016 ;  Levy, 2010 ). In the present paper, a scenario-based experimental  design along with sketches was used to enable confounding factors to be  controlled ( Choi & Mattila, 2016 ). A factorial between-subject experimental design was adapted, involving 2 (burkini-wearing versus bikiniwearing respondents) x 2 (old versus young other unknown customers)  x 2 (similar versus different appearance of other unknown customers).  Consistent with prior research (e.g.  Johnson & Grier, 2013 ), the focus  was on extreme points on the continuum of heterogeneity (i.e. those  who preferred burkini and bikini swimsuits), resulting in eight experimental conditions in total (see  Table 1 ). Similarity in appearance was  operationalised by comparing the respondent's preferred type of  swimsuit with those featured in a given sketch (see  Appendix no. 1 ). For  instance, if the respondents' preference (e.g. a tankini) was different  from those featured in the sketch (e.g. a bikini), they were discarded.  4.2.1. Setup  Consistent with previous research ( Yan et al., 2011 ), four sketches,  featuring a group of six women wearing swimsuits, were developed by a  professional artist. The four sketches were meant to be identical in  everything except the look of the face, body skin (i.e. meant to reflect  age), and the type of swimsuit. The sketches were pretested among  three different samples (50 respondents each) to ensure the success of  the manipulation.  4.2.2. Participants  200 female students of a public university were recruited to participate in the experiment in exchange for partial course credits. As established in prior research (e.g.  Cowart & Lehnert, 2018 ;  Levy, 2010 ),  the choice of a student sample is appropriate because the service experience was suitable for them and they were qualified on the basis of  having a recent service experience ( Delcourt, Gremler, De Zanet, & van  Riel, 2017 ). Consistent with prior research (e.g.  Pounders et al., 2015 ),  only female subjects were considered in the experiment because females are more sensitive to social cues than males ( Hwang & Han,  2017 ). The average age of the respondents was 20 years, who had spent  around 3 h on a beach in a typical day at a coastal resort. Eleven out of  the 200 respondents were discarded for either correctly guessing the  purpose of the experiment ( Thakor et al., 2008 ) or preferring to wear  different swimsuits (e.g. a tankini) than those used in the experiment.  To this end, 189 responses were found valid for the data analysis.  4.2.3. Experimental procedures  The subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four sketches.  Next, they responded to general questions on their preferred swimsuit,  satisfaction with their body image and their attitudes to the experience  of sunbathing on the beach. Once the participants completed the first  part of the survey, consistent with previous studies on inter-personal  social contact ( Husnu & Crisp, 2010 ), they were asked to read the following scenario while looking at one of the four sketches (see  Appendix  no. 1 ).  “Imagine you went with your family to a seaside resort. Upon arrival, you went to swim ALONE because your family was tired that  day and you encountered other resort guests (featured in the sketch)  sharing the same beach with you.”  Next, they responded to the realism and manipulation checks and  finally to questions related to the dependent variables.  4.2.4. Control variables  Time spent on a beach, care for personal body image and attitude to  the experience of sunbathing on the beach were all controlled.  Consistent with prior research ( Choi & Mattila, 2016 ), having companions during the encounter was also controlled in the scenario because  the presence of companions usually makes people less conscious of  other customers ( Huang & Hsu, 2010 ).  4.2.5. Measurement  Multi-item reflective scales were used for the three endogenous  constructs. The scale of attitude to a resort (three items) was adapted  from  Thakor et al. (2008) . Patronage intentions (three items) were  sourced from  Yi (1990)  and  Day and Stafford (1997) . Interactive intentions (five items) were adapted from  Thakor et al. (2008)  and  Sweeney and Wyber (2002) . Consistent with prior research, attitude to  a resort and patronage intentions were measured on five-point semantic  differential scales, with minimum = 1 and maximum = 5. The scale of  interactive intentions was measured on five-point Likert-type scaled  items, with anchors of 1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree.  Further, the control variables were measured by single-item scales. In  particular, care for personal body image and attitude to the experience  of sunbathing were measured on five-point semantic differential scales,  with anchors of 1 = not much and 5 = very much. The scale of time  spent on a beach in a typical day was measured by a ratio scale.  4.2.6. Manipulation and realism checks  The average realism check was 4.1 out of 5. The manipulation  checks were successful. Age estimations for the elderly/bikini condition  (M  = 52.4 years old, S.D. = 8.4) were found to be insignificantly ( t  value = 1.006,  P  value =  0.317 ) different from elderly/burkini condition (M  = 50 years old, S.D. = 6.9), but it was significantly different  from  both  the  young/bikini  condition  (M  = 25.3  years  old,  S.D. = 5.5) ( t  value = 18.151,  P  value =  0.000 ) and the young/burkini  condition (M  = 24 years old, S.D. = 5.3) ( t  value = 19.470,  P  value =  0.000 ). There were no significant differences ( t  value = 1.068,  P  value =  0.289 ) between the young/bikini and young/burkini conditions in the estimated age of the women featured in the sketches. The  respondents successfully identified the type of swimsuit featured in the  sketch. \",\n",
              " \"experience for visitors and the proper protection of resources.  In Poland, the Great Masurian Lakes region is one area where naturebased tourism has been developing. Although the region is not designated  as a national park, the mosaic of lakes and forests, together with the traditional rural landscape, have been attracting tourists for many years. In  the past few years the number of tourists has increased significantly – by  35% between 2010 and 2015 ( Derek, Woźniak, & Kulczyk, 2017 ) and,  therefore, management of the area must take into account both environmental threats and the interests of various groups of tourists.  This study develops a typology of tourists visiting the Great Masurian  Lakes as a function of the activities they undertake. In a second step, we  identify differences between these types in terms of travel patterns and  spatial behaviours, and the economic value given to nature. This is  achieved using a cluster analysis based on survey data. Following previous  work (e.g.  Konu, Laukkanen, & Komppula, 2011 ;  Mehmetoglu, 2007 )  segmentation was activity-based and characterized by the demographic  features of tourists and their travel patterns. Although these aspects are  very important, it is also essential to understand the spatial distribution of  clusters within the area, and (especially in a nature-based destination) the  value different types of tourists attach to nature. In this paper, we aim to  address both of these aspects using spatial analysis methods and the Individual Travel Cost Method. Identifying differences is especially useful for  planning tourism within the perimeter of the destination, as well as for  developing diverse marketing strategies for tourism development.  3. Methodology  3.1. Study site  The Great Masurian Lakes region is located in north-east Poland and  covers 2811 km . The area consists of 10 municipalities, including seven  small and medium-sized towns ( Fig. 1 ). With its numerous lakes, forests,  fields and meadows, it is widely perceived as a nature-based destination. A  broad range of outdoor activities that are more-or-less active, and landand water-based can be undertaken, almost exclusively in summer. The  area is particularly interesting for sailors as it is the only place in Poland  (and one of only a few in Europe) with such a long inshore sailing area: the  primary route is 110 km long, with numerous secondary waterways. This  means that sailors can travel for many days, mooring in marinas or offshore (using their yachts as accommodation).  3.2. Data collection  We carried out an on-site survey of tourists. As  Wall Reinius (2011)  oints out, questionnaires are widely used for collecting data on tourists  in natural areas. The survey was conducted in nine towns or villages  throughout the area, i.e. in every municipality in the area (see  Fig. 1 ).  Specifically, it was undertaken in front of convenience stores or small  supermarkets (if there were any) as we assumed that every tourist (from  sailors to leisure tourists) has to purchase food and drink from time to  time. We deliberately chose not to collect data in tourist centres, tourist  accommodation facilities, marinas, or any other tourist establishments,  in order to avoid any particular activity having an undue influence. For  example, more sailors or others interested in water-based activities  would be found in marinas or near the shores of a lake, while more  leisure tourists would be found in hotels, etc. The aim was to obtain a  sample that was as reliable as possible in terms of the representativeness of the activities undertaken by tourists.  The survey was carried out over two weekends and two different  working days during the summer of 2014, in the morning, during the day  and in the evening, simultaneously at all nine locations. It was conducted  in Polish as, according to official statistics, domestic clientele constitutes  the main group of visitors in the study area ( Derek et al., 2017 ). Noneligible respondents were filtered out (e.g. local residents or people whose  stay in the region was unconnected to tourism or leisure). A pilot survey  was run over a weekend in June. Fifty tourists in the four biggest towns  were asked to complete the survey, to ensure that the questionnaire was  complete, clear, and reliable. This resulted in the introduction of some  changes. The questionnaire was broken down into several sections: general  questions about the visit (such as the reason for travel, length of stay);  respondents’ socio-demographic background; detailed questions about  their accommodation; and very detailed questions about what outdoor  recreational activities were undertaken during their stay.  Respondents could choose from seventeen outdoor recreational activities. This list was developed from a literature review and the authors’  experience of tourism in the region. It included eight water-based activities  (bathing in a lake or a river, sailing, fishing, using a boat or pedalo,  kayaking, motor boating, windsurfing, scuba diving) and nine land-based  activities (walking, picking mushrooms or wild fruit, horse riding, cycling,  sunbathing or picnicking, visiting natural attractions, observing wild animals, outdoor motorsports, paragliding). Respondents were also asked to  indicate if they had participated in any other activities that were not listed  (nothing significant was reported). They were asked to indicate if, and  how often, they had performed a given activity during their stay.  Responses were recorded on a five-point ordinal scale, where: 1 = no,  2 = rarely, 3 = from time to time, 4 = often, 5 = very often, and  9 = difficult to say (coded as missing values).  A total of 516 interviews were conducted with tourists using a paperand-pencil questionnaire. Fourteen were excluded from the analysis because of incomplete responses, leaving a total of 502. Data were entered  into the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software to calculate clusters and carry out statistical analyses. ArcGIS 10.5 software was  used to map where clusters stayed and analyse their spatial distribution.  Data on location of accommodation facilities and the number of  beds were collected from the municipalities and local tourist organisations, and, where necessary, supplemented by phone interviews.  3.3. Data analysis  3.3.1. Clustering procedure  An exploratory cluster analysis ( Hair, Black, Babin, & Anderson,  2014 ) was performed in order to produce activity-based segments. The  aim was to distinguish clusters of visitors by the type and frequency of  their nature-based recreation activities.  A hierarchical clustering procedure was adopted based on  Ward  (1963) . This procedure creates a treelike structure and generates a  complete set of solutions, ranging from all one-member clusters to the  one-cluster solution where all observations are in a single cluster. The  researcher can observe and control the process and judge how many  clusters should be retained, rather than deciding the number of clusters  in advance. Ward's method is appropriate when the researcher wants  clustering patterns to reflect clusters of more-or-less equal size ( Hair  et al., 2014 ) and the dataset does not include outliers ( Mooi & Sarstedt,  2011 ). It provides a useful indication of the number of groups to be  used for operational purposes.  As recommended in earlier work ( Hair et al., 2014 ), the squared  Euclidean distance was used as the distance measure. The ordinal scale  was treated as if it was a ratio scale. As  Mooi and Sarstedt (2011)  note,  market researchers usually treat ordinal data as metric data to calculate  distance metrics by assuming that scale steps are equidistant. This approach is also widely used in tourism studies (e.g.  Konu et al., 2011 ;  Mehmetoglu, 2007 ;  Weaver & Lawton, 2005 ).  A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) identified any statistically significant differences between clusters in terms of variables. Fstatistics indicated which factors best differentiated segments, while pvalues indicated the level of significance.  In order to define and name clusters we calculated the mean for  every activity within each cluster and compared this to the mean for the  whole sample. This captured the key characteristics of each cluster and  made it possible to name it as a function of the activities that were  undertaken most frequently by its members.  3.3.2. Demographic analyses  Regarding demographic characteristics, comparisons between clusters included: gender, age, educational level, place of residence, length  of stay, visitor type, number of people in the group, and respondents  travelling with children.  3.3.3. Individual Travel Cost Method  The Individual Travel Cost Method measured the economic value  that each cluster placed on nature. In this method, the value of a given  good is estimated based on how much people pay (or are willing to pay)  to  access  and  ‘use’  it  ( Czajkowski,  Giergiczny,  Kronenberg,  &  Tryjanowski, 2014 ). Assessing the monetary value of non-market goods  is a helpful management tool, as it makes it possible to compare various  types of goods and use scenarios. It is also an important marketing tool,  because monetary value is easy to understand for non-specialists and  therefore helps to make the vague notion of the value of nature real.  Our analysis included the following elements (see  Kulczyk, Derek, &  Woźniak, 2016  for more details):  − The cost of the journey: calculated as the sum of the cost of travel  distance (distance travelled from the place of residence to the destination multiplied by the price of fuel) and cost of travel time  (journey time multiplied by the cost of journey time, described as a  percentage of the mean wage in Poland). Travel distances and times  were calculated using Google Maps based on data provided by  surveyed individuals;  − Accommodation cost: the mean price of accommodation per activity  type multiplied by the respondent's length of stay. In the case of  sailors who used their yacht as accommodation, marina fees were  used;  − Use cost. The cost of activities undertaken by tourists estimated on  the basis of the cost of equipment rental.  All of the above costs were calculated in Polish zloty, recalculated  into euros and summed to obtain individual, per tourist, travel costs.  Next, means were calculated for each cluster.  3.3.4. Spatial analysis  Spatial analysis of distribution of clusters' members was done based  on their places of accommodation. All places of accommodation reported in the survey, and their spatial distribution, were mapped. The  clusters’ distribution was also compared to the location of all accommodation facilities in the study area.  Clusters were evaluated by analysing their geographic distribution  and spatial patterns. The same procedure was used regarding the supply  of accommodation facilities. The following measures were used:  − Directional Distribution (Standard Deviational Ellipse) ( Chew, 1966 ;  Mitchell, 2005 ;  Wang, Wenzhong, & Zelang, 2015 ) summarizes the  geographic distribution of features: central tendency, dispersion,  and directional trends (rotation). The  x  and  y  axes of an ellipse are  calculated separately as a standard distance in the  x  and  y  direction  from the mean centre which is the average  x  and  y  coordinate of all  the features in the study area. The measure was used, for example,  in monitoring urban activity using mobile phone–based sensor data  ( Ahas et al., 2015 ), or in analysing the dispersion of historic  monuments ( Jażdżewska, 2018 ).  − Average Nearest Neighbour ( Ebdon, 1985 ;  Mitchell, 2005 ) is used in  order to measure the degree of spatial clustering. It was used, for  example, in order to identify clustering patterns of restaurant location in Hamilton ( Prayag, Landré, & Ryan, 2012 ), or to analyse  clustering of tourist attractions in Macedonia ( Vasiliadis & Kobotis,  1999 ). It measures the Euclidean distance between each point and  the location of its nearest neighbour. Next, the average distance is  calculated on the basis of all partial distances. This is compared to  the average for a hypothetical random distribution. The average  nearest neighbour ratio index is established by dividing the observed distance by the hypothetical one. The pattern of the analysed  dataset is said to be spatially clustered if the index < 1 or dispersed  if the index > 1. Values around 1 indicate a random distribution.  The confidence level indicates the percentage of cases with the  pattern indicated by the nearest neighbour ratio.  − Multi-Distance Spatial Cluster Analysis is based on Ripley's K-function ( Bailey & Gatrell, 1995 ;  Mitchell, 2005 ) and is used to quantify  the degree of spatial dependence (see for example clustering of fast  food restaurants in Chicago;  Austin et al., 2005 ). It determines  whether the clustering of features is statistically significant or dispersed over a range of Euclidean distances from the geometric  centres of classes. In our case, five ranges were taken into account.  The confidence envelope, which determines statistical significance,  was established using nine permutations to obtain a graph that  shows the expected, random pattern and the observed pattern. The  dataset is spatially clustered if the curve of the observed pattern is  above the expected one, otherwise it indicates dispersion ( Fig. 2 ).  The Standard Deviational Ellipse method was applied to identify the  location of accommodation where tourists stayed. The latter two methods  aim to indicate the spatial pattern of tourists constituting each cluster.  3.3.3. Individual Travel Cost Method  The Individual Travel Cost Method measured the economic value  that each cluster placed on nature. In this method, the value of a given  good is estimated based on how much people pay (or are willing to pay)  to  access  and  ‘use’  it  ( Czajkowski,  Giergiczny,  Kronenberg,  &  Tryjanowski, 2014 ). Assessing the monetary value of non-market goods  is a helpful management tool, as it makes it possible to compare various  types of goods and use scenarios. It is also an important marketing tool,  because monetary value is easy to understand for non-specialists and  therefore helps to make the vague notion of the value of nature real.  Our analysis included the following elements (see  Kulczyk, Derek, &  Woźniak, 2016  for more details):  − The cost of the journey: calculated as the sum of the cost of travel  distance (distance travelled from the place of residence to the destination multiplied by the price of fuel) and cost of travel time  (journey time multiplied by the cost of journey time, described as a  percentage of the mean wage in Poland). Travel distances and times  were calculated using Google Maps based on data provided by  surveyed individuals;  − Accommodation cost: the mean price of accommodation per activity  type multiplied by the respondent's length of stay. In the case of  sailors who used their yacht as accommodation, marina fees were  used;  − Use cost. The cost of activities undertaken by tourists estimated on  the basis of the cost of equipment rental.  All of the above costs were calculated in Polish zloty, recalculated  into euros and summed to obtain individual, per tourist, travel costs.  Next, means were calculated for each cluster.  3.3.4.

All places of accommodation reported in the survey, and their spatial distribution, were mapped.

The confidence envelope, which determines statistical significance,  was established using nine permutations to obtain a graph that  shows the expected, random pattern and the observed pattern. The  dataset is spatially clustered if the curve of the observed pattern is  above the expected one, otherwise it indicates dispersion ( Fig. 2 ).  The Standard Deviational Ellipse method was applied to identify the  location of accommodation where tourists stayed. The latter two methods  aim to indicate the spatial pattern of tourists constituting each cluster.  4.4.2. Individual Travel Cost Method  The two clusters that value nature the most are  sailors , especially  angling sailors , whose per-person travel costs are estimated at an average of  325 euros. This is because the cost of renting a yacht is very high (use cost)  and angling sailors stay for the longest time among all clusters (see section  4.4.1 ). On the other hand, sailors rarely pay for accommodation, as they  often sleep on their yachts that are moored offshore.  Clusters that spend the least money are  water recreationists  (107  euros) and  passive tourists  (114 euros). This may be explained by the fact  that neither cluster participates in a specialized activity, and the activities they do undertake the most often (walking, sunbathing, or even  bathing in a lake or a river) can be done almost anywhere. They also do  not spend money on facilities (use costs are estimated at 8 euros in both  cases).  Travel costs clearly divide clusters into two groups:  sailors , whose  travel costs are derived from use costs (renting yachts) and others  whose costs are mainly associated with accommodation. Journey costs  are least diverse among clusters (the maximum is around 20%).  Anglers ,  angling sailors  and  sailors  have the highest costs, as they travel the  longest distances to their destination ( Fig. 7 ) (see  Table B  and  Table C  in  the Appendix for detailed data).  4.4.3. Spatial behaviours  Fig. 8  shows the spatial distribution of each cluster. The percentage  of cluster members staying in a given place of accommodation and  standard deviational ellipses are shown. Most tourists in each cluster  congregate in towns located near the large lakes along the main sailing  route. There are, however, some differences.  Cyclists  stay close to the largest lakes, exploring the area along the  north–south axis. Their dispersion along the east–west axis is the  smallest among all groups. The semi-minor axis of cyclists’ standard  deviational ellipse constitutes only 28% of the semi-major axis.  Water  recreationists  are present in all of main locations almost equally.  Members of this cluster are also accommodated in towns that are not on  the main sailing route. This group has the largest range, and their  standard deviational ellipse occupies 46% of the study area.  Passive  tourists  congregate principally in towns in the central and northern part  of the study area, while they are far less numerous in villages. They only  explore 36% of the study area.  Anglers , in turn, use small lakes much  more intensively than other groups and are mostly accommodated off  the main tourist trail (except for the two main tourist hubs: Mikołajki  and Giżycko).  Anglers  and  non-angling sailors  have similar standard deviational ellipses. The disproportion between semi-axes is smallest, the  semi-minor axis comprising around 43% of the major axis, indicating  that they are widespread over the region.  Angling sailors  are the only  group who are mainly accommodated on lakes or in villages. They  principally explore the largest interconnected lakes and tend to stay in  the northern part of the sailing route, which is less crowded. At the  same time, their range of exploration is limited (36% of the study area).  Average Nearest Neighbour analysis shows that all groups are spatially  aggregated, while  angling  and  non-angling sailors  are most aggregated  (ratio = 0.26, confidence level 99%). This is likely to be due to the environment: sailing space is principally limited to interconnected large  lakes. The ratio of the other four groups is around 0.46 (confidence level  99%), which also indicates a high level of spatial aggregation within  clusters. It is much higher than the ratio of all the beds in accommodation  facilities, which means that the accommodation facilities are much more  concentrated in the study area than the clusters’ members.  A deeper analysis of tourists' distribution uses a Multi-Distance  Spatial Cluster Analysis based on Ripley's K Function. This finds two  spatial behaviours.  Angling sailors  is the only group that is aggregated in  all distance ranges, indicating that wherever they are in the study area  they tend to stay in groups. This is similar to the accommodation facilities, which are also aggregated in all distance ranges. For the other  five clusters, tourists are aggregated up to a certain distance from the  geometric centre of the class, ranging from 10 km ( non-angling sailors ) to  14 km ( anglers ). Finally,  Fig. 9  shows that the spatial behaviour of the  latter groups of tourists is random.  4.4.4. Overall cluster characteristics  Overall, clusters differ in terms of their socio-demographic characteristics, travel costs and spatial behaviour.  Table 3  presents the main  features of each group.  Activity-based clustering may be a useful and efficient way of developing a typology of tourists ( Moscardo et al., 2001 ). As the outdoor  activities they undertake reflect their relationship with nature, clustering tourists by activity in a nature-based destination seems to be a  particularly useful way to find out how they use it. Such knowledge  may not only serve the tourism industry ( Mehmetoglu, 2007 ), but also  contribute to our knowledge of the human–nature relationship. Our  study shows that the method works well in practice, as significant  differences between clusters were identified.  The continuous growth of tourism in natural areas requires an ongoing search for new methods and instruments to help in assessing how  tourists use and value nature. This knowledge is crucial in improving  the planning and management of nature-based destinations. Our research not only presents an activity-based segmentation, but also goes  one step further by adding spatial analyses and the Travel Cost Method.  It demonstrates that combining all of these methods can do more than  just segment tourists into relatively homogenous, activity-based groups.  Like many other studies, the framework makes it possible to characterize each group by its social and demographic features and travel  patterns. However, clusters can also be described by their spatial behaviour and the economic value they give to nature. The findings show  that cluster analysis, which is principally a marketing tool used by  companies to segment visitors, may be also an extremely useful tool for  planners and destination managers. In this way, the study takes a holistic approach to the analysis of tourism demand in a nature-based  destination, and, as such, contributes to the discussion on tourists’ use  of a nature-based destination.

              " '3. Methodology  In this study, we explore tourist complaining practices on social  media and their potential for value co-creation and co-destruction, in a  naturalistic context. In doing so, we consider whether each complaint  practice could be characterized by a distinct type of customer value  ( Sheth et al., 1991 ;  Smith & Colgate, 2007 ) which may form during the  performances of complaining on social media. Our investigation focuses  on the dynamic interactions between consumers and the organization,  and between consumers themselves, that are observable on the Facebook pages of a large Australian-based airline company  Qantas,  and its  low-cost airline subsidiary  Jetstar.  The Qantas Group is the largest  airline in Oceania ranked by the number of passengers transported  (53.5 million in 2016/2017 FY). The  Qantas  Facebook page had  828,933 fans when this research was conducted, growing on average by  8232 new fans per month. The  Jetstar  Australia Facebook page had  630,911 fans, growing steadily with an average of 1877 new fans  joining the page per week. Each of these Facebook pages offers  visitor  posts , a feature whereby consumers can post freely on the public forum.  Consequently, these pages are a common space for consumers to express their complaints ( Cakmak & Isaac, 2012 ), which makes these  social media pages an appropriate research site for our study.  Data collection was conducted using online archival methods of the  Facebook posts that appeared from January to June 2017. Consistent  with previous studies ( Mariani, Di Felice, & Mura, 2016 ;  Mariani, Mura,  & Di Felice, 2018 ), this study focuses on Facebook, as it is the most-used  social media platform among national tourism organizations ( Mariani  et al., 2018 ) and individuals, with more than 2.23 billion monthly active users ( Statista, 2018 ). The  ‘ visitor posts ’  were extracted using  NCapture software, a web browser extension designed to capture online  content, such as social media posts. The extracted content was then  imported to NVivo for further analysis. During this six month period,  there were 915 original visitor posts on  Qantas  and 1098 original visitor  posts on the  Jetstar  pages respectively. Of these posts, over threequarters reflected some form of complaint. The total data downloaded  amounted to more than 292 single-spaced pages of 12-point-font text,  representing approximately 130,348 words, as well as significant visual  data in the form of uploaded photos. The total number of postings in  which a complaint behavior was observed was approximately 1509.  We adopted a two-stage iterative process to analyze the data: in the first stage, we conducted an open-ended exploration of the conversations that appeared on the social media pages with the purpose of understanding the context of such conversations and of particular complaints that they reflected. The inductive analysis of these conversations  was guided by an emergent theorizing process, where the key concepts  about tourism complaints were first understood in the context of their  respective posts and then compared and categorized in order to elicit  higher order abstractions based on their perceived commonalities and  linkages ( Spiggle, 1994 ). At this stage, we also developed provisional  categories and conceptual connections by using the constant comparative method, where we would go back and forth dialogically between the emergent themes from the posts and the elements of practices  from the literature ( Schau et al., 2009 ;  Shove & Pantzar, 2005 ). This  iterative process heightened our sensitivity to the context of investigation, and aided subsequent induction of the broader underlying  themes about tourist complaining practices, and their embodied performances ( Reckwitz, 2002 ) on social media.  At the second stage, we revisited our preliminary theme of tourist  complaining practices with the purpose of understanding how the  specific interactive performances by actors (i.e., consumers and organizations) resulted in either co-creative or co-destructive value formation ( Echeverri & Skålén, 2011 ). In particular, we analyzed how value  formation unfolded dynamically within the interactions observable on  social media for each complaining practice, paying particular attention  to the specific aspects of the actors ’  performances (e.g., language, observable intentions, specific tactics, etc.) that contributed to co-creation  or co-destruction. Such an approach enabled us to identify common  patterns of interactive performances that fostered co-creation or codestruction, thereby extending our analysis to account for the potential  of tourist complaint practices to foster these two dimensions of value  formation ( Echeverri & Skålén, 2011 ). This second and final iteration  formed the basis for refining our themes in their final form, which are  presented in the findings. Trustworthiness was ensured through regular  discussions of emerging interpretations between the authors to allow  for multiple interpretations, while adhering to the principle of suspicion  ( Klein & Myers, 1999 ). In addition, a summary of findings was offered  to a colleague (assistant professor level) for comments, and these were  used to amend the article. ',\n",
              " \"3.1. Method  Following the qualitative approach advocated in previous tourism  research, we used the approaches of literature analysis and in-depth  interviews to explore, in depth, the nature of home-sharing stay experience from the perspectives of both hosts and tourists ( Beeho &  Prentice, 1997 ;  McIntosh & Siggs, 2005 ;  Prayag, Hall, & Wood, 2018 ).  Experiential dimensions identified in the qualitative research will serve  as a foundation for the measurement instrument development for the  quantitative research, which will be used to examine how different  dimensions of home-sharing stay experience impact tourism experience  and destination image perception. In-depth interviews were conducted  with 3 hosts and 7 tourists who had extensive home-sharing stay experiences. In order to increase the diversity of our sample, we identified  3 hosts who were managing home-sharing lodgings in the provinces of  Guizhou, Xi'an, and Tibet. Their home-sharing lodgings had received  high ratings online due to high-quality of experiences provided to  tourists. Tourists with extensive home sharing experiences were identified using a snow ball sampling technique. The sample size was terminated at the point of redundancy when no new information was  forthcoming ( Patton, 1990 ). Tourists who were interviewed had extensive home-stay experiences in different locations including rural  areas, big cities, small towns, with most of the home-sharing lodgings  being located near famous attractions. This ensured that our qualitative  data covered tourists' experiences with a very diverse home-sharing  lodging options, which is likely to increase the generalizability of our findings.  The interview protocol was designed based on the literature review  and expert panel discussions. The interview protocol primarily consisted of two parts. The first part was about identifying the key factors  that determine home-sharing stay experience. Questions for tourists  included, for example, what is your most memorable home-sharing stay  experience? Why is it so memorable and what are the special things that  impressed you? Questions for hosts included, for example, what do you  think are the most important aspects that determine tourists' experience  in a home-sharing lodging? What aspects will you try to improve in the  future in order to provide a better tourist experience? The second part  was about comparing home-sharing experiences with mainstream accommodation experiences such as hotels. Questions for tourists included, for example, what are the unique experiences that you obtained  from home-sharing lodgings as compared with hotels? Questions for  hosts included, for example, why do you think tourists would choose  your home-sharing lodging over hotels? Interview protocol utilized a  semi-structured interview method with certain flexibility ( Kvale, 1997 )  to enable interviewees to openly and honestly talk about their homesharing stay experiences. The interviewees aged between 20 and 32  years, with 4 males and 6 females and 80% of them held a Bachelor's  degree or a higher degree. The interviewees had stayed an average of 9  nights in home-sharing lodgings. We conducted 6 face to face interviews at Sichuan province and 4 telephone interviews during September 2017. On average, each interview lasted about 50 min.  3.2. Results  During the process of data collection, each in-depth interview was  audio-recorded and handwritten notes were taken. Recordings of the  interviews were then transcribed into text files. We adopted  Strauss and  Corbin's (1990)  open, core, and axial coding procedures to analyze the  qualitative data collected from both hosts and tourists. Through open  and core coding, we identified 23 clustering subcategories. Through  axial coding, guided by the four dimensions of intimacy theory, we  have identified 6 dimensions of home-sharing stay experience including  space presence, social presence, host-interaction, guest-interaction,  knowledge sharing, and activity sharing (as shown in  Table 3 ).  Space  presence  refers to the exposure of tourists to the local design and local  facilities in the home-sharing lodging, and it relates to physical intimacy, which highlights actual contact of experiential consumption.  Social presence  refers to a sense of social warmth due to the sharing of  opinions and values, and it relates to spiritual intimacy, which focuses  on value and belief sharing.  Host interaction  and  guest interaction  refer to  the interaction and communication between the host and guests and  among guests, and these two dimensions relate to the verbal intimacy,  which highlights the exchange of words and communication. Finally,  knowledge sharing  and  activity sharing  refer to the exchange of knowledge and co-participation of activities among the host and guests, and  these two dimensions relate to the intellectual intimacy, which centers  on sharing reflection and disclosures of knowledge.  Based on the results of the analyses of the literature review and  interviews, a measurement instrument to measure home-sharing stay  experience was proposed following the methodology proposed by  Hoehle and Venkatesh (2015) . The proposed measurement scale was  composed of 23 items (see Appendix A for details). \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  This section describes our framework for travel itinerary analysis  based on topic modeling. The frameworks contains four major stages: 1)  Travel Data Collection : Collecting travel data that capture the travel  behavior and activities of tourists; 2)  Itinerary Construction : Processing  of raw travel data into a suitable format that represents travel itineraries; 3)  Probabilistic Topic Modeling : Applying topic modeling techniques to formatted travel itineraries to discover underlying travel topics;  and 4)  Exploratory Analysis : Conducting statistical analysis of the discovered topics with respect to travel groups and destination countries  for insights into travel behavior. The details of these four stages are  presented in this section.  3.1. Travel Data Collection  This stage collects travel data that capture the comprehensive travel  behavior and activities of tourists along their trips. We employ usergenerated data on social media sites, such venue check-ins ( Vu et al.,  2018a ), as our data source owing to their large-scale availability with  comprehensive activity information. Venue check-ins, especially on the  Foursquare platform, have been shown to be effective in capturing the  travel activities of tourists ( Kotiloglu, Lappas, Pelechrinis, & Repoussis,  2017 ;  Luo et al., 2019 ) and reflecting their implicit interests in the  visited locations or venues ( Kessler, 2010 ). One issue with Foursquare is  that there is no function to directly identify users and their check-in  records. However, with the integration of their systems, Foursquare  check-ins can be extracted via the Twitter platform.  The process of extracting venue check-in data is carried out in two  steps. First, Foursquare users who have integrated their system with the  Twitter platform are identified by using a streaming function, which is  available in Twitter's application programming interface (API) (developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html). The streaming function can retrieve  random tweets being generated all over the world in real time. We  apply a filter using the keyword  “ swarmapp ”  to extract only tweets  generated by the Foursquare check-in application Swarm. The check-in  tweets are collected together with their meta data, such as UserID and  Location of Origin, which are useful in identifying individual users of  interests. For instance, if we are interested in studying the travel behavior of users from a specific country, then the UserID of users having  the same country of origin are selected for further data extraction. In  the second step, the travel history of selected users is extracted by using  another of Twitter's API function, called getUserTimeline. This function  is deployed with the keyword  “ swarmapp ”  to extract check-in tweets  available in the Twitter timeline of such users.  Once the check-in tweets are collected, we extract a link in the meta  data that points to the original check-ins on Foursquare to extract relevant information about the check-ins. These data include venue name,  location, category, local date, and time, all of which are useful to  construct travel itineraries in the next stage. We are aware that Twitter  has a quota limit for free access to its API. However, the streaming  function can be kept deployed for a long time. Moreover, massive volumes of data are generated every day, and so the collected data set is  large and su ffi cient for studying the travel behavior of tourists ( Cheng,  Caverlee, Lee, & Sui, 2011 ).  3.2. Itinerary Construction  The collected venue check-in data need to be processed and transformed into a suitable format before topic modeling can be applied.  Foursquare provides a comprehensive list of venue categories classified  into 10 major types, including Art and Entertainment, College and  University, Event, Food, Nightlife Spot, Outdoors and Recreation,  Professional and Other Places, Residence, Shop and Service, and Travel  and  Transport  ( https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/  categories ). Each type contains multiple categories and subcategories.  The check-ins of each user are arranged according to the temporal order  of date and time. Each check-in records a visit of the tourist to a specific  venue, which is useful to infer associated activities. For instance, a  check-in at a restaurant could indicate dining, while a check-in at a  shopping mall or department store could indicate shopping activities.  Travel itineraries can be constructed in different ways depending on  the study contexts of inbound or outbound travel behavior. If researchers are interested in studying the travel behavior of a specific  group of users, the check-ins made by those users outside of their home  countries can be used to study their outbound travel behavior. Checkins made in the home country of the users, but in different cities or  town, can be used to study their domestic travel behavior. If the context  of study is on inbound tourism, then the check-ins of all visitors in a  specific destination are collected for analysis. The itineraries can be  constructed and analyzed at the trip level, spanning multiple days for  overall understanding on their trip preference, or at the daily level to  provide detailed insights into their behavior and daily activities.  The aim of travel itinerary analysis using topic modeling is to  identify the activities that are commonly included in the same itineraries for travel package development and recommendation. Therefore,  only travel itineraries that contain a su ffi cient number of check-ins to  the travel patterns are included in the analysis. The minimum number  of check-ins varies depending on the analysis context. A high minimum  threshold can be specified for trip-level analysis, while a low minimum  threshold can be specified for daily-level analysis.  3.3. Probabilistic topic modeling  Given a set of collected travel itineraries, the next stage is to apply  topic modeling to discover the topics hidden within, which represent  the profile of itineraries and the preferences of tourists. We utilize a  probabilistic topic modeling technique, LDA, to fulfill this task. LDA is a  powerful state-of-the-art topic modeling technique that can discover  underlying topics in a large collection of documents ( Foulds, Boyles,  DuBois, Smyth, & Welling, 2013 ). LDA's modeling of topics is in the  form of probability distributions over topics and associated words,  which are convenient for interpretation and analysis of their meanings.  We first provide the fundamental concepts of LDA and then explain how  LDA can be applied to the itineraries constructed from venue check-in  data.  Let  be a collection of  documents, with each  document  having a length of  words. The values of  vary depending on the length of each document. LDA models each document as a topic mixture over  topics, which are characterized by vectors  of  word  probabilities  .  Each  topic  mixture  is a probability vector of length , . Each  word probability vector  of topic  has a length corresponding to the number of words in the vocabulary, .  The model assumes that the topic mixtures  and the word probabilities   follow a Dirichlet distribution with parameters  and , respectively  ( Foulds et al., 2013 ).  Assume that the topic word probability  and Dirichlet parameter are given. LDA assumes the following generative process for a document ( Blei et al., 2003 ):  Huy Quan Vu, Data Collection, Data Analysis, Result Report and  Paper Writing.

              " \"( Pan et al., 2014b ), correlation analysis between affective qualities of  places/landscape and the descriptive adjectives were conducted by  “ content analysis ”  and  “ semiotic analysis ”  ( Albers & James, 1988 ).  Third, photos as indicators for diagnosing the TDI divergences between  DMO (destination management organizations) and tourists, tourists &  residents, are different information resources ( Choi, Lehto, & Morrison,  2007 ;  Mak, 2017 ;  Valek & Williams, 2018 ;  Önder & Marchiori, 2017 ).  Fourth, photos as logos serving for branding landmarks. The most suitable landmarks photos were found through the content analysis of  tourist  geo-tagged  photos  ( Kennedy,  Naaman,  Ahern,  Nair,  &  Rattenbury, 2007 ).  Methodology for visual content analysis.  Visual content analysis  is a systematic, observational method used for exploring how the  studied phenomenon is represented ( Bell, 2001 ). It allows the quanti- fication of samples of observable content classified into distinct categories ( Bell, 2001 ;  Mak, 2017 ). Content analysis is attribute-based and  is primarily concerned with quantitatively describing the appearance of  specific themes and attributes in the collection of images, allowing the  main focal items in the pictures to be identified and their frequencies,  co-occurrence, clustering, and other related issues to be recoded  ( Stepchenkova & Zhan, 2013 ). Trained category and coding researcher  are the crucial part of the procedure. In addition, Mise en scene refers to  shot density, shot scale, shot angle, and shot composition, which has  been employed as a complement for visual content analysis. NVivo,  textblob, ThoughtView, and other related software are applied as tools  for data statistics.  Compared to the tourism destination image, the concept of city  image has existed in the research field of urban space for decades.  Lynch maintained that city image formation is the result of a bilateral  process led by the observer and the environment ( Lynch, 1960 ). City  image, which includes both of the tourists' and residents' perspectives,  is utilized in the initial phase of a city's brand development ( Kavaratzis,  2004 ;  Oshimi & Harada, 2018 ). There are already several attempts in  the field of city and urban planning with Visual content analysis of UGC  photo. For example, Liu downloaded photos of 26 cities in the world (an  average of 100,000 photos per city) with geographic information from  Panoramio and Flickr using python scripting language, and categorized  the photos into 102 scenes and 7 perceptions (the Green Perception,  Water Perception, Transportation Perception, High-rises Perception,  Architecture Perception, Socializing Perception, and Athletic Perception) by content analysis, which is built on a computer vision technique  - scene understanding. The characteristics and spatial distribution of  seven perceptions were statistically analyzed ( Liu, Zhou, Zhao, & Ryan,  2016 ). Except the image issue, online data shared on social networks,  particularly geo-tagged photos, are taken as an increasingly attractive  source of information about cultural ecosystem services, a content  analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio has been  conducted in five European cities for exploring how they represent  cultural ecosystem services ( Oteros-Rozas, Martín-López, Fagerholm,  Bieling, & Plieninger, 2018 ).  Excepted using UGC photos as the resource for the exploration of  city image, goolge street view (GSV) is another photo resource for  content analysis in the urban study. Study issues include urban greening  ( Li, Ratti & Seiferling, 2018 ;  Li & Ratti, 2018 ), Neighborhood walkability ( Yin, Cheng, Wang, & Shao, 2015 ), Bikeability ( Evans-Cowley &  Akar, 2014 ), perceived naturalness ( Hyam, 2017 ), public open spaces  ( Mygind et al., 2016 ) and so on. Nearly all the new emerging studies  with content analysis using GSV has employed a deep learning method  by computer vision technology ( Rzotkiewicz, Pearson, Dougherty,  Shortridge, & Wilson, 2018 ). All these give inspiration for the pictorial  content analysis with big data in tourism research.  Therefore, big data has uniqueness and advantages compared to  traditional data collection, and the content of the photo also holds great  potential and effectiveness compared to textual material. It is the inexorable tendency to use deep-going mining for applying the visual  pictorial contents into tourism research in the social network occupied  era, as it is the most popular visual information in our present world  and filled all the corners. Currently, the research concerning visual  content-analysis fall into two approaches: one is the conventional way,  which manually identifies visual contents of photo and taking attached  textual information as complement, and the other is an emerging approach which interpreting the photo's content with the help of computer vision technology. For the conventional content analysis, the  limited numbers of photos constrained the size of the sample, and the  instability and irregularity of artificial coding for the visual content  category show a common drawback. On the contrary, the emerging  approach has an unparalleled advantage in the big datasets and relatively standardized classification processing by machine learning.  However, the conventional approach holds a relatively mature conceptual and theoretical framework compared to the study using computer vision technology. Also, a well-designed and performed deep  learning technology itself takes great time and energy in the phase of  coding and machine training.  This study will refer to the theoretical framework of the conventional visual content study, and adopt an already well-performed visual  content identification process in computer vision technology, and then  explore the characteristics of tourist perception and the reflected destination image by combining the results of the pictorial content analysis  and geo-tagged based spatial analysis.  4. Methodology  4.1. Research process  The overall research is divided into four steps, the first step is data  collection and screening, the second step is the process of photo content  analysis by computer deep learning model, the third step is the analysis  of the results, which includes comparative perceptual analysis of tourists from different places in the world and spatial distribution with  different preferences, and then the conclusion of the study is the last  step ( Fig. 1 ). Compared to the conventional photo-based tourism research methods, the substation of the artificial intelligence approach for  natural intelligence approach in step 2 is the innovation, and the category developed based on the output of the machine learning model is  a new way of induction for destination cognitive image analysis.  Data collection and screening has been introduced in section  3 . In  step 2, the deep learning model of scene recognition is employed for  recognizing the contents of tourists' photos. The purpose of scene recognition is to identify the tourist photos referring to 103 scenes, and  each photo would belong to one unique scene. In step 3, statistical  analysis and spatial analysis are conducted in parallel as two independent and complementary approaches for analyzing the data results of scene recognition, tourists' home information (country and  continent), and photos' geographical information (longitude and latitude) are applied for comparative statistic analysis and spatial positioning. Statistical analysis is mainly to detect perceptual differences  between tourists from different countries and continents. Hierarchical  clustering analysis and ANOVA (analysis of variance) are the specific  methods in statistical analysis. Spatial analysis is applied to discover the  spatial distribution characteristics of tourists' behaviors preference with  different scenes by the help of ArcGIS. The last part is responding to the  research objective based on the analysis process and comes to a conclusion.  4.2. Deep learning models for recognizing photos' content  This study employs widely spread ResNet ( He, Zhang, Ren, & Sun,  2015 , pp. 770 – 778) for the image classification task-scene recognition.  This deep learning structure obtained very successful results in these  two computer vision competitions-ImageNet and MS-COCO. The core  idea exploited in these models -residual connections, is found to improve gradient flow greatly, thus allowing training of much deeper  models with tens or even hundreds of layers. Three realizations which  are ResNet-50, ResNet-101 and ResNet-152 are proposed, then it  chooses ResNet-101 in these experiments. A demonstrated model  structure with only 101 layers is shown in  Fig. 2 . As an output, 103  scenes are recognized by taking tourists' photos as input. The designing  of the machine learning model for scene recognition is the key technology of this study. As it is already a mature field in computer vision,  there are many frontier papers about the details (structure and code) of  the model ( Cheng, Zhang, Fan, & Harris, 2018 ;  Meiyin & Li, 2015 ).  This applied deep learning model has been tested with experimental  data, experimental results show that it is e ffi cient and robust for scene  recognition with recall rate and high precision, the recall rate achieved  90% , and the false recognition rate is 0.1%. The recall rate indicates  the ratio of the number of identified scenes to the total number of this  scene. The false recognition rate means the proportion of the number of  the false identified scenes to the total number of this scene.  4.3. Perceptual categories developed from 103 scenes  103 scenes are too fragmented to analyze the general characteristics  of tourists' perception. By referring to the similarity of tourists' perception, 103 scenes are reclassified into 11 categories ( Table 1 ), which  covered most tourists' perception in tourism destinations.  4.4. Tools for statistical and spatial analysis  In this study, the tools of analysis of variance and hierarchical  cluster analysis were used for statistical analysis, and fishnet and kernel  density analysis in ArcGIS were used for spatial analysis.  ANOVA is a collection of statistical models developed by Ronald  Fisher ( Fisher, 1921 ), which could be used to analyze the differences  among group means in a sample. This model provides a statistical test  of whether the population means of several groups are similar and to  what extent, and therefore generalizes the  t -test to more than two  groups. ANOVA is useful for comparing three or more group means for  statistical significance. In this study, ANOVA aims to detect whether a  statistic significance exists in tourists from different places of the world.  Hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis which seeks to  build a hierarchy of clusters. The principle of this method is to define  the similarity or distance between network nodes by a given network  topology structure, and then use single-link hierarchical clustering or  full-link hierarchical clustering to form a tree-like graph hierarchical  structure of network nodes. With this tool, the similarities and divergence of tourists' behaviors and perceptions from different continents  and countries/regions could be explored.  By using fishnet in ArcGIS, Beijing was divided into 5 km * 5 km  grids, with matching the longitude and latitude attributes of photos, the  place where the photos were shot could be located, and the number of  photographs in each grid is counted. Through this process, the distribution of the tourists' footprints could be displayed. The kernel  density analysis in ArcGIS could calculate the density of point elements  around each output raster pixel, which is the best option for visualizing  the aggregation characteristics of tourists' behavior and perception in  Beijing. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Sample and data  The sample of this study consists of all major industries with twodigit North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes and  subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industry with up to six-digit  NAICS codes (where the data were available) for the period from March  2006 to June 2018. This period covers all the available monthly employee wages data from the earliest date to the most recent time.  Monthly employee earnings growth rates in major industries with  two-digit NAICS codes and employee earnings growth rates in subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industry in the U.S. and in selected  states are the study's dependent variables. The terms  “ employee earnings ”  and  “ base  employee  earnings ”  are  used  interchangeably  throughout this study, which do not include the tips that employees in  the leisure and hospitality industry might receive. The monthly employee earnings growth rate of the overall U.S. economy and the  earnings growth rate of the overall state economy in the selected states  are the study's independent variables.  An additional sample was obtained to examine the effects of the  importance of the leisure and hospitality industry in a given state's  economy, as measured by the weight of the leisure and hospitality industry in that state's overall GDP. This sample consists of Delaware,  Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota,  Vermont, and Wisconsin for the period of 2001Q1 to 2017Q1. This  period covers all the available employee wages data from the earliest  date to the most recent time at a state level.  States were sorted into two portfolios. All 50 states and Washington,  DC were ranked based on the weight of the leisure and hospitality industry in the state's overall economy. Specifically, each state's ranking  was based on the following method.  (1)  where  is the GDP weight of the leisure and hospitality  industry of state  i . Then, the states were ranked based on the respective  GDP weights of the leisure and hospitality industry. The top five and  bottom five states based on the rankings were selected to examine the  extent to which changes in the employee earnings in the leisure and  hospitality industry are caused by changes in employee earnings in the  overall U.S. economy and the overall state economy, controlling for the  importance of the leisure and hospitality industry in the state's  economy. Accordingly, we included Nevada (rank #1), Hawaii (rank  #2), Vermont (rank #3), Florida (rank#4), and Montana (rank #5) in  the top five portfolio; and Wisconsin (rank #47), Iowa (rank #48),  Nebraska (rank #49), Delaware (rank #50), and North Dakota (rank  #51) in the bottom five portfolio.  Average weekly employee wages (full time employees) data were  used to estimate employee earnings growth rates, which was obtained  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the United States  Department of Labor. The employee earnings were adjusted for inflation utilizing the consumer price index (CPI). CPI data were also obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The GDP data were obtained  from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a unit of the United States  Department of Commerce.  Importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the hospitality  industry together with the leisure industry. That is, based on the Bureau  of Labor Statistics ’  definition, subsectors of the hospitality industry are  classified under the leisure and hospitality major sector. Therefore, the  comparisons and analyses in major industries were made based on the  leisure and hospitality industry. Nevertheless, further analyses were  conducted to investigate employee earnings growth in the subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes the main hospitality  sectors.  3.2. Empirical design  Ordinary least square regression was used to estimate the market  model, which predicts the relationship between the employee earnings  growth rate in a particular industry and in the overall economy. To  estimate the market model, the earnings growth rate was calculated as  follows.  (2)  where  is the earnings growth rate of industry  i  on time  t ,  is the  average weekly earnings for industry  i  in time  t , and  is the average  weekly earnings for industry  i  in time  t-1.  To estimate the earnings  growth and volatility, we employed the market model. The model is  specified as follows.  (3)  where  is the earnings growth rate of industry  i  in time t,  is the  earnings growth rate in the overall U.S. economy in time t, which is  calculated using  formula (2) ,  is the random disturbance term, and and  are the market model parameters. All models include year fixed  effects to control for time-specific economic and other conditions over  time. We also include month fixed effects and quarter fixed effects to  control for seasonality in the monthly data and quarterly data, respectively. Furthermore, state level analyses include state fixed effects  to control for state-specific dynamics and characteristics.  The beta coe ffi cient,  shows the extent to which earnings in an  industry move in parallel with the earnings in overall U.S. economy.  That is, a  of 1.5 suggests that employee earnings in industry  i  increase  by 1.5% when employee earnings in in the overall U.S. economy increase by 1% in a given period. Conversely, a  of 0.5 indicates that  employee earnings in industry  i  increase by only 0.5% when employee  earnings in the overall U.S. economy increase by 1% in a given period.  The beta coe ffi cient is labeled as a measure of economy-driven growth  in employee earnings in industry  i . The alpha coe ffi cient,  shows the  extent to which earnings in an industry increase or decrease independently of the overall economy. If alpha, for example, is equal to  0.5, it suggests that employee earnings in industry  i  have increased  0.5% independently of the increases in employee earnings in the U.S.  economy. The alpha coe ffi cient is a measure of industry-driven growth  in employee earnings in industry  i.  3.3. Summary statistics  Fig. 1  presents the historical employee earnings (CPI adjusted) of  major sectors in the U.S. for the period between 2006 and 2018. Notably, employee earnings in the leisure and hospitality industry are  below the average employee earnings in the U.S. While industries like  trade, transportation, and utilities and other services (except public  administration), for instance, are also below the average employee  earnings in the U.S., earnings in the leisure and hospitality industry are  the lowest during this period.  To put the employee earnings in these industries in perspective, the  mean differences between employee earnings in major industries and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. were analyzed. The industries  were ranked based on their average earnings, where industries with  higher earnings ranked in the highest order.  Table 1  presents these findings. The results show that employee earnings in the U.S. as a whole  were $710, on average, while employee earnings in the leisure and  hospitality industry were $311. Indeed, the difference is not only statistically but also economically significant.  We further analyzed the mean differences between employee  earnings in the subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industries and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. We also ranked the subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality based on their average earnings, where industries with higher earnings ranked in the highest order.  Table 2  presents these results.  The results show that the mean differences between employee  earnings in the subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industry and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. are significantly different. The  independent artists, writers, and performers (NAICS 711500) and  spectator sports (NAICS 711200) industries are the only subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality industry with employee earnings higher than  the average employee earnings in the U.S. Although still lower than the  average employee earnings in the U.S., employee earnings in the arts,  entertainment, and recreation (NAICS 71) super sector and its subsectors, such as museums (NAICS 712110), historical sites (NAICS  712120), and so on appear to be better than earnings in the accommodation and food services (NAICS 72) super sector and its subsectors,  such as full-service restaurants (NAICS 722100), hotels (except casino  hotels) and motels (NAICS 721110), etc. Restaurants, in general, appear  to have the lowest employee earnings. Specifically, the limited-service  eating places (NAICS 722200) sub-sector has the lowest earnings with  $232 average weekly earnings. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  Creswell and Plano Clark's (2007)  suggestions for using a mixedmethods study design aim at helping researchers avoid inconsistent  conclusions caused by just focusing on quantitative or qualitative  analysis. Employing an explanatory sequential design, this study aims  at understanding how tourism firms can achieve higher performance in  changing environments by conducting a quantitative study followed by  a qualitative study with the same respondents. Following the recommended procedure for fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis  (fsQCA) as a mixed-methods approach to discover how configurations  of key factors internal and external to the firm translate into higher financial performance ( Harms, Kraus, & Schwarz, 2009 ;  Ragin, 2008 ;  Woodside, 2013 ), the empirical part of this study is split into two steps.  In the first step, quantitative data are collected via an online questionnaire sent to tourism firms in Austria, a country with a well-established tourism industry, encompassing 140.9 million overnight stays  in 2016 and ranking 5th out of 29 European tourism regions ( WKO,  2018 ). About 20% of the country's workforce is directly or indirectly  employed in this sector and in 2015, the tourism industry's direct and  indirect contribution constituted 16.1% of the country's GDP (Tirol  Werbung, 2017 ). In a second step, to interpret and extend the explanatory power of the results of fsQCA, a qualitative follow-up study  with owner-managers that display features of each one of the configurations from the sample of tourism firms in the earlier quantitative  study is conducted.  3.1. Quantitative sample  To assure heterogeneity and representativeness among the firms in  the sample, 1000 randomly selected firms from the tourism and hospitality industry in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce's database of  owner-manager led firms ( Getz et al., 2004 ), the dominant form of  Austrian tourism firms ( Doerflinger, Doerflinger, Gavac, & Vogl, 2013 ),  were invited via email to participate in a survey from September to  November 2017. This selection guaranteed a key informant approach,  i.e. the firms' key informants and most knowledgeable information  sources were addressed, as being common practice in EO studies  ( Lumpkin & Dess, 2001 ). The questionnaire was developed on validated  scales from literature (see section 3.1.1). As these scales were originally  in English, they had to be translated to German by two academics for  conducting the survey in Austria. To assure accurate and comprehensible translation, the questionnaire was pre-tested by two further academics and two practitioners for wording, content and structure to  develop the final version of the questionnaire. A total of 113 complete  surveys were returned, equaling a response rate of 11.3%, which is in  the range of prior similar surveys with entrepreneurs (e.g.,  Sieger,  Zellweger, & Aquino, 2013 ). As the numbers of full-time employees of  the sample (see  Table 1 ) show, all of the respondents' firms are small  and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), most of them small (< 50 employees), which indeed describes most of the firms in the tourism industry in general ( Middleton, 1998 ;  Morrison & Teixeira, 2004 ).  3.2. Qualitative sub-sample  In the second step of the study, 25 respondents from the survey of  the first step were subsequently and according to their fsQCA configuration contacted via email and invited to participate in a qualitative  follow-up interview. The aim of this process was to interview representatives for each configuration and discover statements that help  to gain deeper insights into the respective configuration, which leads to  higher performance ( Woodside, 2014 ). Eventually, 13 face-to-face  interviews representing all configurations, and with an average duration of 36 min were conducted from December 2017 to February 2018.  Table 2  provides an overview of these sample firms. Different types of  tourism firms such as hotels, restaurants, cafés, ski schools, apartment  rentals and sports outfitters were considered for this follow-up study.  However, since the hotel sector is dominant in Austrian tourism (Tirol  Werbung, 2017 ), it is somewhat inevitable that most of the firms in the  sample were predominantly active in hospitality.  3.3. Quantitative study  3.3.1. Measures  Data for the quantitative study was measured using 5-point Likerttype scales (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). To measure EO,  the three sub-dimension scales from  Eggers et al. (2013)  were used,  who adapted the original  Covin and Slevin (1989)  scales to a small-firm  context:  Innovativeness  was measured with a five-item scale, particularly  focusing on innovation behavior.  Proactiveness  was assessed with a fiveitem scale, measuring how eager firms are to identify and take advantage of market opportunities.  Risk-taking  was evaluated with a fouritem scale, which concentrates on measuring the perception and management of uncertainty and risk within a company.  Networking  was  measured with the two-item scale from  Hills and Hultman (2006) ,  which evaluates a company's information exchange with its personal  and professional network. Financial resource constraints were measured by assessing financial  resource availability  on a four-item scale  ( Atuahene-Gima et al., 2005 ).  Environmental uncertainty  was measured  on a three-item scale reporting the technological turbulence in the  business environment based on  Narver et al. (2004)  and  AtuaheneGima  et al.  (2005) .  Following  numerous  studies  from  the  entrepreneurship domain (e.g.,  Chen, Tzeng, Ou, & Chang, 2007 ;  Davidsson, Steffens, & Fitzsimmons, 2009 ;  Eggers et al., 2013 ),  performance  was measured as an index of sales, profit, employee and market  share growth. All items that form the respective constructs can be seen  in  Table 3 .  A factor analysis was conducted to estimate the convergent validity  and reliability of the constructs. Factor loadings (> 0.6) and Cronbach's  Alphas (> 0.7) all reached satisfying levels ( Hair, 2006 ) and thus, dimensionality and reliability of all constructs was considered acceptable.  To test for non-response bias, the 20% first and 20% last respondents  were compared via an ANOVA, as late respondents tend to be more  similar to non-respondents ( Armstrong & Overton, 1977 ). No significant differences for these two groups were found.  Following similar studies using fsQCA in an entrepreneurship context (e.g.,  Hughes et al., 2018  or;  Kraus, Mensching, Calabrò, Cheng, &  Filser, 2016 ), the sample was split into two groups for comparison  reasons. As previous research identified environmental uncertainty to  be one of the major drivers for entrepreneurial behavior (e.g.,  Bstieler,  2005 ), a  high  and a  low environmental uncertainty  group was defined to  consider the effect of these external forces influencing entrepreneurship  development in the tourism industry ( Carmichael & Morrison, 2011 ;  Köseoglu et al., 2013 ). These  environmental uncertainty  groups were  developed on the basis of average uncertainty ( Ragin, 2008 ), using the  mean of 3.02 as a guiding value, which means that all firms with an  environmental uncertainty value below this number were considered  group 1 (low uncertainty; 72 firms) and all with a value identical or  above the mean were considered group 2 (high uncertainty; 41 firms).  3.3.2. FsQCA technique  Data were further analyzed by employing the analytical set-membership technique fsQCA, which stems from complexity theory ( Ragin,  2008 ) and is used to categorize antecedents into causal configurations  ( Chang & Cheng, 2014 ;  Cheng, Chang, & Li, 2013 ;  Kraus, RibeiroSoriano, & Schüssler, 2018 ). FsQCA allows researchers to overcome  various limitations that are part of regression-based analysis as it enables the identification of complex combinations of conditions that  result in particular outcomes ( Skarmeas, Leonidou, & Saridakis, 2014 ).  Contrary to traditional techniques that treat causal conditions as independent variables, fsQCA offers a logical representation and analysis  of causal conditions and exhibits configurations of conditions. The  method facilitates the examination of how different combinations explain a result and offers a reason for more than a single combination of  conditions that lead to above-average outcomes ( Woodside, 2013 ) such  as firm performance, which was the goal of this study and followed the  strong interest of extant literature to focus on explaining high firm  performance (e.g.,  Hughes et al., 2018 ;  Kraus et al., 2016 ).  For the calculation, it is necessary to determine values for the  transformation of common data into fuzzy sets on the basis of  Ragin  (2008)  and  Woodside (2013) . Accordingly, the process of transforming  variables into sets requires the specification of full membership (95%),  full non-membership (5%), and cross-over anchors (50%) in order to  transform antecedents and performance into fuzzy variables. This study  set the original values of 5.0, 3.0, and 1.0 from five-point Likert scales  based on  Ragin (2008)  and  Woodside (2013)  to respectively correspond  to these memberships.  In addition, this study focused on using the truth table algorithm to  recognize configurations that are su ffi cient for the outcome by selecting  both the minimum recommended consistent cut-off value as 0.75 and  the number-of-cases threshold as 1 based on  Fiss (2011)  and  Ragin  (2008) . Setting the number of cases threshold to 1 means that a con- figuration of factors needed to appear in at least one case to be considered a relevant outcome. Maintaining a threshold of 1 also means  that logical remainders are eliminated and that all cases are considered  in the identified configurations. This way, this study follows Ragin's  procedure (2008), who finds intermediate solutions (i.e., only logical  remainders based on easy counterfactuals are used) superior to both  complex (i.e., no logical remainders are used) and parsimonious solutions (i.e., all logical remainders are considered whether they are based  on easy or di ffi cult counterfactuals). The cut-off value was set to 0.75,  so the configurations that are su ffi cient to the outcome could be recognized ( Fiss, 2011 ). The fsQCA truth table algorithm ( Ragin, 2008 )  was then utilized to generate various, possible and logical combinations  of su ffi cient causal conditions in low and high uncertainty environments that lead to an above-average performance.  3.4. Qualitative follow-up study  As recommended by  Woodside (2014) , a qualitative follow-up study  was conducted to gain deeper insights into the performance configurations identified by fsQCA. This type of analysis makes it possible to  generalize beyond distinct examples but also enables researchers to  gain a better insight by examining individual cases ( Ragin, 2008 ). This  meets the idea of prior qualitative research that is said to be especially  useful for an in-depth investigation of entrepreneurs ’  values, attitudes  and meanings ( Carmichael & Morrison, 2011 ;  Crouch & McKenzie,  2006 ).  Owner-managers from each of the configurations identified in the  quantitative study were interviewed. Questions drew on the items from  the quantitative study and management literature ( Atuahene-Gima  et al., 2005 ;  Covin & Slevin, 1989 ;  Eggers et al., 2013 ;  Hills & Hultman,  2006 ) and are summarized in  Table 4 . Further optional functional  questions were asked to understand how the interviewees perceive respective factors to work and influence the performance of their firm ( De  Massis & Kotlar, 2014 ).  The interviews were all tape-recorded and transcribed. In a next  step, the content of the interviews was structured according to the  identified configurations from the quantitative study. As the original  data were in German, relevant quotes illustrating the different configurations were independently translated into English by two of the authors to ensure accuracy and meaningful translations of quotes. Finally,  the translations were compared and a professional language editor was  consulted to ensure precise wording. As well as helping to interpret the  results of the quantitative study, the gathered information of the followup study also helped to name the six identified categories from the  quantitative study. \",\n",
              " \"2. Methodology  The present study explored the relationship between loneliness and  the use of Airbnb from the perspective of host-guest interactions. This  forms part of a larger semi-structured interview study with both Airbnb  hosts and guests aimed at exploring their motives, perceptions and  behaviours. Here, we report findings from 15 hosts and 21 guests that  are pertinent to the present purpose. In particular, interview findings  with cohabiting hosts and guests were used to examine loneliness as a  driver to using the Airbnb platform and, specifically, how host-guest  social interactions may mitigate loneliness. Interviews were conducted  via Skype between May and December 2018 with the sampling process  being facilitated by the principal investigator's involvement in a relevant European Union COST Action, which allowed her access to  Airbnb hosts and guests across Europe. Purposive sampling was employed with the researchers considering the backgrounds, age and  gender of the informants to ensure that enough diversity is included  ( Ritchie, Lewis, Nicholls, & Ormston, 2014 ) within the sample. Data  were analysed thematically whereby with blocks of verbatim text being  copied, re-organised and cross-referenced to allow the identification of  thematic categories. \",\n",
              " 'To present tourism ecological security and system operation status  scientifically and reasonably, the selection of measurement models is  crucial. On the one hand, scholars conducted quantitative data analysis  by constructing the evaluation model to explore the development status  of tourism ecological security.  Li, Wu, Wu, and Zhou (2017)  used  mathematical statistics and the GIS spatial analysis method to measure  and analyze the tourism ecological security in 31 Chinese provinces,  and constructed an obstacle factor diagnostic model to explore the  obstacle factors of tourism ecological security.  Chen (2017)  applied the  ecological footprint model to measure the tourism ecology in Taiwan,  and the grey model is used to predict the tourism ecological carrying  capacity.  Liu, Zhang, Wang, and Xu (2018)  constructed a more comprehensive and scientific tourism sustainable development index  system from the perspectives of economic, social, resources and environment, and used the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity  to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to evaluate the sustainable tourism  development of 11 provinces and cities in the Yangtze river economic  zone.  Pueyo-Ros et al. (2018)  created a comprehensive model of  tourism cost and emergency managemen, the Travel Costs and Contingent Behavior (TC + CB), to evaluate the impact of ecological restoration on the recreation value of tourist destinations. On the other  hand, qualitative research method is also used to explore the evaluation  system of tourism ecological security. For example,  Liu et al. (2009)  used the Analytical Hierarchy Process and the Delphi Method to construct the evaluation index system of ecological security of natural  heritage tourism. Although the previous literature has made numerous  efforts to measure tourism ecological security from different research  perspectives, there remains the unsolved question of index comprehensiveness and internal system operation. Some controversies surrounding the methods used to measure tourism ecological security,  such as incomplete measurement methods and inadequate selection of  indicators, meaning the status of tourism ecological security cannot be  accurately evaluated. Therefore, to improve the important evaluation  method of tourism ecological security, this study is based on ecosystem  theory, and deeply analyses the definition and connotations of tourism  ecological security in several steps. First, we select a relatively comprehensive DPSIR framework to create the evaluation system, which  makes up for the problem of incomplete index selection in previous  studies. Second, we combine the efficiency evaluation method to  measure the “quality” of tourism ecological security, which can address  the problem of previous research only evaluating the “quantity” of  tourism ecological security ( Dong et al., 2018 ).  2.3. DPSIR framework  The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model was established in 1993 by the European Environmental Agency (OECD)  based on the PSR and DSR frameworks: “Driver” and “Impact” indicators were added in DPSIR conceptual framework ( Waheed, Khan, &  Veitch, 2009 ). The DPSIR model examines the interrelationship between people and the environment from a system perspective. This  model is systematic and comprehensive, and enables a more comprehensive monitoring of the continuous feedback mechanism between the  indicators. Importantly, one of the main goals of the DPSIR model is to  assess efficiency ( Ness, Anderberg, & Olsson, 2010 ), which is mostly  used for environmental assessment, resource management ( Kagalou,  Leonardos, Anastasiadou, & Neofytou, 2012 ), etc. However, few studies  have focused on it. Only the latest research regards DPSIR model as an  important guiding framework to explore the index construction of  sustainable development ( Asmelash & Kumar, 2019 ), which shows the  completeness  and effectiveness of the DPSIR model.  The DPSIR model can effectively measure the operational status of  the tourism ecosystem. Compared with other evaluation models, the  advantages of the DPSIR model are found in two aspects. First, the  DPSIR model has the advantages of comprehensive content and strong  logic ( Ehara et al., 2018 ), and DPSIR framework fully reflects the interaction relationship among tourists, tourism destinations and environment. Specifically, “driver” is a potential factor that puts pressure  on the tourism ecosystem, including the direct drivers and indirect  drivers of tourism economic development and social and economic  development. ‘Pressure’ comprises the factors that pose a threat to  tourism ecological security through the direct effects of the driver, reflecting the consumption of resources by tourists and local residents  that end up causing environmental pollution and other pressures  ( Benitez-Capistros, Hugé, & Koedam, 2014 ). “State” is the state of coordination of the tourism economy, ecological environment and  tourism industry under pressure. The “impact” is the comprehensive  impact on the development of the social economy and the tourism industry when the tourism ecosystem is under shock and pressure ( Li,  2004 ). “Response” comprises some measures  provide d to maintain the  stable operation of the tourism ecosystem; these measures include  prevention, compensation, and improvement ( Cooper, 2013 ). Second,  the DPSIR framework shows that the “circulation” characteristics of the  ecosystem operation and its critical five indicators have a “ring” relationship with a single direction ( Wang, Sun, Li, & Zou, 2016 ). The  hidden drivers that cause risks affect the good environmental status,  resulting in a series of pressures, such as people and nature, people and  tourism, tourism and nature. Once the tourism ecosystem is in an unbalanced state, it will counteract the social economy and tourism development. In this case, a series of corresponding measures are needed  to actively respond, and the response levels will affect the coordinated  development of the tourism ecosystem.  Importantly, scholars have proposed that it could be improved in  combination with other methods ( Bell, 2012 ;  Maxim, Spangenberg, &  O\\'Connor, 2009 ). The traditional DPSIR model only measures the development status of each subject of regional tourism ecological security  ( Malekmohammadi & Jahanishakib, 2017 ). It cannot comprehensively  evaluate the internal interaction and operational efficiency of the  tourism ecosystem, however, and unable to evaluate whether the factor  investment of tourism destination effectively meets its ecological security  needs. Moreover, ecosystem theory asserts that the elements of the  system must reach a state of coordination and unification ( Reynolds,  2002 ), and this kind of harmonious and unified state can be measured  through efficiency. Therefore, efficiency evaluation is the best way to  measure the input and output of resources to reflect the comprehensive  effect of the input and output of factors such as the economic development of tourism activities and ecological environment, rather than the  result of a single factor input or output ( Zha, He, Liu, & Shao, 2019 ).  Which reflects that tourism ecological security is the comprehensive effect of the input and output of factors such as economic development of  tourism activities and ecological environment etc, rather than the result  of a single factor input or output. Therefore, this study combines the  DPSIR framework with the DEA efficiency model to improve the tourism  ecological security evaluation model.  2.4. Current gaps in the literature  To better clarify the necessity of this study’ s exploration of the  innovation of tourism ecological security evaluation methods and the  critical driving mechanism, we comprehensively review the related  previous studies, and highlight the current research gaps in the tourism  studies sector.  First, we examine the perspective of the foundational theory for  tourism ecological security evaluation. Previous studies have  ignore d  the need to provide a theoretical basis for tourism ecological security  measures; however, a strong theoretical background is not only helpful  to clarify the interactions among the multiple subjects in the tourism  ecosystem but also to transform the complex system operation mechanism into simple explanations ( Gursoy & Nunkoo, 2019 ).  Peng et al.  (2018)  asserted that to maintain the security of the ecosystem, certain  elements must be maintained in a coordinated and unified state. Further, ecosystem theory provides important theoretical background and  guides us to realize that tourism ecological security must consider the  balanced state of the input and output of each factor in the system  evaluation ( Dong et al., 2018 ). Therefore, this paper introduces the  ecosystem theory as the foundation of the explanation of the tourism  ecological security.  Second, although many evaluation models for tourism ecological  security have been established by tourism scholars, such as Ecological  Conservation Development Areas(ECDA) ( Tang et al., 2018 ), the  TOPSIS method ( Xu, Liu, Li, & Zhong, 2017 ), and spatio-temporal dynamics analysis ( Lu, Wang, Xie, Li, & Xu, 2016 ), they cannot fully cover  the multiple elements in the system, which shows the unilateral evaluation results, ignoring the comprehensive index and the dynamic  development. This study introduces the “Driver-Pressure-State-ImpactResponse\" framework, which not only fully reflects the affinity relationships among the tourist, destination and environment and multilevel characteristics of the assessment element but also notes the circulation characteristics of the system’ s dynamic development.  Third, scholars often use a single evaluation framework or model to  evaluate tourism ecological security. Tourism scholars note, however,  that the combination of assessment framework and multiple methods is  the trend of future assessment, which not only provides diverse perspectives for phenomena explanations, but is also helpful in examining  complex systems ( Bell, 2012 ). Therefore, this study integrates the  DPSIR framework and SBM-DEA method and provides innovative perspective in the evaluation of tourism ecological security.  Fourth, previous studies have asserted that exploring the influencing factors is helpful to identify the obstacles to tourism ecological  security ( Peng et al., 2018 ). Most scholars, however, used regression  equations or qualitative studies to explain tourism ecological security  ( Tang et al., 2018 ), which failed to identify the core influencing factors,  and supplied no addition detail with regard to developmental strategies. Therefore, this study uses the Geo-Detector method to identify the  core influencing factors of tourism ecological security.  Fifth and finally, although previous studies have summarized the  formation path of tourism ecological security, the construction of the  driving mechanism remains an unsolved question, and as a result, the  operation mechanism of tourism ecological security cannot be systematically constructed ( Xu et al., 2017 ). Based on the DPSIR framework  and the core influencing factors, this study constructs the driving mechanism of tourism ecological security in an all-around and multi-level  way, which is a key contribution.  3. Method and data  3.1. Research method  3.1.1. DPSIR-DEA model  The DPSIR-DEA framework was used to measure the tourism ecological security of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Data Envelopment  Analysis (DEA) is an analytical method proposed by two American  operation researchers,  Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes in 1978  to evaluate  relative efficiency. However, because of today\\'s more complex economic, social and ecological systems, the selection of a single DEA indicator faces a series problems, such as incompleteness and lack of  rationality. Thus, the combination of the DPSIR framework and the DEA  model not only comprehensively covers relevant indicators but also  accurately measures operational efficiency. It is worth noting that the  classical DEA method based on the CCR and BCC models fails to fully  consider relaxation problems of input and output, resulting in deviations  efficiency  measurement  ( Hosseinzadeh  Lotfi,  Jahanshahloo,  Givehchi, & Vaez-Ghasemi, 2013 ). Subsequently, Tone constructed an  undesirable output relaxation metric (Super-SBM) model based on environmental production techniques, which solved the problem of nonzero slack in input or output, and undesired output problems in the  roduction process. Further, these model changes avoid radial and  deviation problems caused by radial and angle selection differences  ( Tone, 2001 ), better reflecting the nature of tourism ecological security  evaluation. Therefore, DPSIR, an evaluation framework covering multiple system elements, was  introduce d, and SMB-DEA is used to solve  the problem of undesired output and measurement of environmental  efficiency ( Wang, Zhang, Fan, Lu, & Yang, 2019 ). A new evaluation  method that combines the DPSIR framework with SMB-DEA model was  created. The mathematical expression is as follows:  (1)  where  ρ represents tourism ecological security while  N ,  M , and  I  represent the number of inputs, desirable outputs, and undesirable outputs, respectively.   ,   and   represent the  slack variables of the input-output, the input-output values of the  production unit  k  at time  v , and the weight of each input-output.  Moreover, the greater the  ρ  value, the higher the security.  In addition, this study used  Wang\\'s et al. (2016)  suggestion to disassemble the DPSIR ring structure into an annual linear structure to  more intuitively present the cyclic characteristics of the DPSIR model  ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Impact and State are the output factors in the  operation of the tourism ecosystem. Moreover, Driver, Pressure and the  Response of the previous year are the necessary input factors for the  efficiency result, which affects the cyclic operation of the system.  Therefore, the study uses Driver, Pressure of tourism and social response as the input factors, the State and Impact as the desirable output  factors, and the ecological destruction pressure as the undesirable  output factor in the DEA model.  3.1.2. Spatial autocorrelation  3.1.2.1. Global spatial autocorrelation . Global autocorrelation is used to  measure the spatial agglomeration characteristics of tourism ecological  security in the YRD. Moran\\'s I index is a commonly used indicator for  global spatial agglomeration effects. The formulas are as follows:  (2)  where  I  indicates Moran\\'s I index;  N  is the number of research units; and  are the attribute values on the  i  and  j  study units, respectively; is the average value of ;  is the sum of all the elements of the spatial  weight matrix; and  is the spatial weight matrix of the study units  i  and  j . The value of  Moran\\'s I  ranges from −1 to 1.  3.1.2.2. Local spatial autocorrelation . Spatial autocorrelation describes  the spatial differentiation characteristic of the research units in the  region in more detail.  Getis-Ord G  is used to measure local spatial  differentiation characteristics and to identify the spatial distribution of  cold spots and hot spots, using the following mathematical expression:  (3)  where  n  is the number of research units; and  are the attribute values  on the  i  and  j  space units, respectively; and  is the spatial weight  matrix. If  G  is positive and significant, indicating the value of position  i ,  and the surrounding areas are relatively high, that is the high level  accumulation area (hot spot area). Conversely,  G  is negative and  significant, this indicates that the value around position  i  is lower than  the mean, belonging to the low level accumulation area (cold spot area).  3.1.3. Geo-detector  Geo-Detector is mainly used to detect differences in geographical  elements and the influencing factors of spatial distribution. Further, the  factor detector is used to detect whether a certain geographical factor is  the reason for the difference in spatial distribution ( Wang et al., 2010 ).  This study uses the Geo-Detector factor detection model to explore the  influencing factors of the spatial characteristics of tourism ecological  security. The main idea is that the relevant factors affecting tourism  ecological security are spatially different. If the factor and the level of  tourism ecological security are spatially significant, it indicates that this  factor is decisive for the spatial distribution of tourism ecological security. The Geo-Detector method used can effectively detect the core  influencing factors of regional tourism ecological security ( Shi et al.,  2018 ). Compared with the traditional regression method used in previous studies, Geo-Detector can not only effectively analyze the differences of spatial influencing factors but also identify the core factors.  Geo-Detector provides a powerful methodological application foundation for how practitioners take action in the future. The specific calculation formula is as follows ( Wang & Hu, 2012 ):  (4)  where  presents the detection force value of the detection factor  D ;  is  the sample size of the entire region;  is the number of samples in the  sublevel region;  is the number of sublevel regions;   is the variance  of the tourism ecological security value; and  is the variance in the  sublevel region. 0≤ ≤1 indicates that the larger the  value is, the  greater the influence of the  D  factor on tourism ecological security.  3.2. Index selection  Evaluation indicators for tourism ecological security include inputs,  desirable outputs and undesirable outputs. In addition, the selection of  input and output indicators is directly related to the science and accuracy of the evaluation ( Korhonen & Luptacik, 2004 ). The tourism  ecosystem covers all aspects of society: the economy, the environment  and tourism development. Combined with relevant research, the indicators of this study include tourism industry development, economy,  population, environment, and resources.  (1) Driver (D) ( Lu et al., 2015 ;  Wang et al., 2016 ). Six indexes are applied: tourism income growth rate, tourist growth rate, tertiary industry growth rate, natural population growth rate, GDP per capita,  and urbanization rate. These indicators are selected from the tourism  industry development and social economic development aspects,  which are important input factors for the operation of the tourism  ecosystem. Tourism income growth rate and tourists growth rate  selected in this study represent the development of the tourism industry. Meanwhile, the tertiary industry growth rate, natural population growth rate, GDP per capita, and urbanization rate illustrate  the current social and economic development situation.  (2) Pressure (P) ( Liu et al., 2017 ,  Liu, Zhang et al., 2018 ;  Wang et al.,  2016 ). Population density, tourist density, and water consumption  per 10,000 yuan are selected as tourism and social pressure (P1).  Meanwhile, waste water discharge and soot emissions are selected  as ecological damage pressure (P2). Specifically, population density  and tourist density may cause a comprehensive pressure on tourism  activities. Moreover, water consumption per 10,000 yuan reflects  the levels of energy consumption and regional energy use efficiency. Further, waste water discharge and soot emissions as negative factors in economic development may cause serious damage  to regional ecological environment.  (3) State (S) ( Chen, Thapa, & Yan, 2018 ;  Lu, Li, Pang, Xue, & Miao,  2018 ). Five indexes – garden green space, per capita park green  area, green area of built-up area, proportion of tertiary industry in  GDP, and total tourism revenue in GDP – are selected as output  indicators. The status indexes are mainly selected from the ecological environment and industrial economic development aspects.  Specifically, the area of garden green space, the per capita park  green area, and green coverage area of established areas represent  the levels of environmental health and sustainable development.  Moreover, the proportion of tertiary industry in GDP reflects the  industrial structure of regions, and the proportion of total tourism  revenue in GDP reflects the contribution of the tourism industry.  (4) Impact (I) ( Liu et al., 2017 ;  Wang et al., 2016 ). Six indexes, such as  tourism economic density, per capita tourism income, tourism foreign  exchange income, domestic tourism income, tourist reception volume  and population ratio, and the number of employees, are selected,  describing the development levels of a region\\'s tourism industry and  service industry. As the output factors of the tourism ecosystem, these  indexes can reflect the impact of system operations on tourism.  (5) Response (R) ( Liu, Zhang, et al., 2018 ;  Wang et al., 2016 ). The  sewage treatment rate, life garbage treatment rate, the proportion  of fiscal expenditure to GDP, and the number of students in ordinary high schools are selected as the input factors for the following year. The sewage treatment rate and life garbage treatment  rate are critical contributors to the sustainable development of the  ecological environment. Moreover, fiscal expenditure reflects the  economic impetus to invest in the ecological environment, and the  number of students in ordinary colleges and universities reflects the  supply of talent for response measures.  Combining the needs and data availability of the DPSIR and DEA  models, this study selects 6 secondary indicators and 26 tertiary indicators, including driver, tourism and social pressure, ecological  pressure, states, impact and response. Among them, driver, tourism and  social pressure and response are input factors. The state and impact are  the desirable output factors, and the ecological pressure is the undesirable output factor. Lastly, the index is standardized, and the  weight of the index is calculated using the entropy method ( Wang et al.,  2016 ). The evaluation index system is shown in  Table 1 .  3.3. Data collection  This study takes 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD), China, as the study site, and  Fig. 1  indicates the 26 cities  of the YRD. The YRD is one of the regions with the highest levels of  urbanization and economic development, and the largest population of  foreigners. With its powerful economic forces and rapid development,  the YRD has become the sixth largest metropolitan area in the world  ( Chen et al., 2018 ). The YRD is the most mature area for tourism development in China. Because of its rich cultural, historical, natural and  other tourist attractions, it has laid an important foundation for the rapid  development of tourism, which is known as the “Golden Triangle” in the  Chinese tourism industry ( Zhang, Gu, Gu, & Zhang, 2011 ). As of the end  of February 2017, there were 38 scenic spots at the 5A-level in 26 cities  in the YRD, including 3 scenic spots at the 5A-level in Shanghai, 18  scenic spots at the 5A-level in Jiangsu, 12 scenic spots at the 5A-level in  Zhejiang, and 5 scenic spots the 5A-level in Anhui, evidence that tourism  resources are extremely rich and highly complementary. However, there  have also been resource shortages and environmental pollution in the  rapid development of tourism in the YRD, which these have become a  potential danger in the sustainable development of tourism. Therefore,  the YRD is a typical and representative study site.  In 2012, China outlined strategic goals for the “Promotion of ecological civilization”. Taking into account the changes and lags in the  implementation of that policy, and the availability of data, 2011–2016  is selected as the research period. Because the response is often used as  an input indicator for the following year, the four indexes of response  are used from 2010 to 2015. Lastly, the data sources come mainly from  statistical data, such as the China\\'s Statistic Yearbook, China City  Statistical Yearbook, China Tourism Statistics Yearbook and China  Environmental Statistics Yearbook.

              " \"4. Method  To address the research objectives, we devised a scenario-based  experiment, a widely employed approach in service research (e.g.  Blodgett et al., 1997 ;  Liao, 2007 ) that is particularly suited to exploring  negative consumption experiences ( Bitner, 1990 ;  Bitner, Booms, &  Tetreault, 1990 ). In addition to overcoming issues of recall bias related  to self-reporting techniques, this approach provides an enhanced level  of control in manipulations ( Smith et al., 1999 ).  The experiment followed a 2 (service failure severity: low vs.  high) × 2 (monetary compensation: no coupon vs. coupon) × 2 (speed  of response: slow response vs. prompt response) between-subject design. Under the two levels of service failure severity, we added a “noresponse” condition to the experimental design for comparison with  alternative response conditions. From a managerial perspective, a  coupon represents the most cost-efficient means of compensating customers among all types of monetary compensation ( Mueller, Palmer,  Mack, & McMullan, 2003 ). The reason is that service providers do not  need to sacrifice any resources unless the customer chooses to use the  coupon for a revisit. This experimental design minimized the inefficient  use of resources and allowed the provision of coupons as monetary  compensation to be examined. Thus, we manipulated the level of  monetary compensation as yes/no instead of high/low ( Mattila &  Cranage, 2005 ;  Mattila & Patterson, 2004 ;  Wirtz & Mattila, 2004 ). In  adherence to the cost-effective principle, the monetary reward was  embodied through a coupon. In addition to being a common form of  compensation through which distributive justice is delivered in service  recovery, coupons are a promotional tool that can boost consumers’  future  purchase  intention  ( Hoffman,  Kelley,  &  Rotalsky,  1995 ;  Kendrick, 1998 ). Hotel operators also largely regard coupons as a  practical, easy-to-allocate reward ( Hocutt & Bowers, 2005 ).  4.1. Simulation materials  Participants were randomly assigned a description of either a “low”  negative or a “highly” negative hotel stay experience (three nights’ stay  for holiday) to trigger their perception of service failure at low and high  levels, respectively. Two similar-length vignettes each described a  consumption experience at the fictitious three-star Diamond Hotel. The  three key aspects of hotel services covered were the building/bedroom,  furniture/equipment, and services. A three-star hotel was selected in  the scenario because it is most likely to be accepted by the general  public and therefore means the participants are more likely to engage  with the scenarios ( Shanka & Taylor, 2004 ). We used three-star hotel  criteria based on the standards of Expedia and Hotelstars Union for  reference and expectation-setting purposes.  To enhance realism and facilitate participants' engagement, we chose  Orlando as the hotel location in the scenario. Orlando is a popular holiday  destination on the U.S. East Coast ( Gollan, 2015 ). Participants, who were  randomly assigned to one of 10 conditions, were asked to imagine that  they had reported the experienced service failure through an online review  on TripAdvisor. Eight out of the 10 conditions were descriptive accounts of  the service provider's response and recovery effort to the participant's  online review. We manipulated the monetary compensation and speed of  response at different levels through coupon giving (one night's free stay vs.  no coupon) and the timeliness of the recovery process (response within  two days vs. response within two weeks). When there was no reply (two  control conditions), participants were informed that the service provider  did not respond to their online review (for details of three of the 10 stimulated scenarios, see  Appendix B ).  4.2. Pretest  We conducted a pretest to perform realism and manipulation checks  before the main data collection and to ensure that the scenarios were  realistic and believable and that the independent variables were successfully manipulated in the stimulus materials ( Blodgett et al., 1997 ).  We recruited an online panel to participate in this pretest, through  which we collected 239 completed surveys. Fifteen respondents failed  the comprehension questions in the manipulation checks, which left  224 valid responses. As social media use can directly influence consumers’ eWOM engagement, we asked a series of filter questions about  eWOM experience and social media use at the outset of the experiment.  Twenty-three participants were filtered out without being invited to  complete the survey due to their limited eWOM experience. This process ensured that the respondents could reasonably imagine themselves  in the scenarios described and provide responses that reflected their  true perceptions ( Zhang, Abound Omran, & Cobanoglu, 2017 ). We removed those who reported having limited eWOM and social media  experience from the sample.  4.2.1. Realism checks  The participants were asked to read the scenarios and rate their  feelings on how realistic the scenario was (experimental realism) and  how likely it was that the situation could happen in real life (mundane  realism) ( Liao, 2007 ;  Roschk & Kaiser, 2013 ). Seven-point Likert scales  were employed to assess the experimental and mundane realism of the  experimental design.  Hair, Black, Babin and Anderson (1998)  suggest  each experimental condition should include at least five participants to  ensure the validity of the experimental design. To enhance the reliability and generalizability of the realism checks, we went beyond the  minimum requirement and recruited at least 20 participants in each  experimental  condition.  We  conducted  one  sample  t -test  (test  value = 4) for all experimental conditions. The realism checks ( Table 1 )  indicated that the situations in the scenarios were experimentally and  mundanely  realistic  (t-values > 1.96,  p < .05)  ( Chawdhary  &  Dall'Olmo Riley, 2015 ;  Field, 2009 ).  4.2.2. Manipulation checks  We measured  service failure severity  using scales adopted from  Hess,  Ganesan, and Klein (2003) . Three 7-point semantic scales required the  participants to rate whether the service failure was “severe,” “major,”  or “significant” in the stimulus material (α = 0.89;  Hess et al., 2003 ).  An independent  t -test demonstrated the effectiveness of the manipulation checks in service failure severity ( M  = 5.88, SD = 1.28 vs.  M  = 3.47, SD = 1.42;  t (222) = −13.31,  p  < .001).  The control condition instead asked the participants, “In the scenario above, did you receive response from the hotel after leaving an  online review?” (yes/no). Only three of the 239 participants failed to  answer this question using the response conditions in the scenarios to  which they were allocated. The 98.7% accuracy suggests that the response condition (with response vs. without response) was effectively  manipulated. Participants allocated to the no-response conditions were  not required to complete the other manipulation questions.  We manipulated  monetary compensation  by whether the scenario  included coupon giving. Three questions, displayed sequentially, examined the manipulation of monetary compensation: “Were you given  any monetary compensation by the hotel?” (yes/no), “Which type of  monetary compensation did you get from the hotel?” (discount/  coupon/refund), and “How much is the face value of the coupon?” (one  night's stay/two nights' stay/three nights' stay). Participants in the “noresponse” conditions were directed to the manipulation questions. Only  12 of the 236 participants failed to provide answers that matched their  assigned scenarios. The accuracy rate for this set of questions was 95%,  suggesting that the manipulation of monetary compensation was effective.  We measured  speed of response  on a single-item 7-point Likert scale  adopted from  Liao (2007) : “According to the scenario, the hotel reacts  promptly to your online review.” An independent  t -test indicated that  the response speed was effectively manipulated in the stimulus materials  ( M  = 5.09,  SD = 1.47  vs.  M  = 2.92,  SD = 1.27;  t (176) = 11.47,  p  < .001).  4.3. Data collection procedure  Following the successful manipulations and realism checks, we used  the same data collection technique and selection criteria for the main  study. We recruited an additional 360 participants (59.7% female, aged  18–80 years). The dependent variables included attitude towards the  service provider (α = 0.95;  Rodgers, 2003 ), recovery satisfaction  (α = 0.93;  Roschk & Kaiser, 2013 ), and eWOM continuance intention  (α = 0.89;  Lee, 2010 ). After reading the hotel stay scenario, participants rated their experience on a 5-point scale ranging from terrible (1)  to excellent (5), similar to that used by TripAdvisor. This rating was  useful in helping diagnose the perceived severity of the service failure  in the eWOM context.  Appendix A  provides the questionnaire. \",\n",
              " '3. Methods and measures  Most prior work on the effects of country brand imagery has  adopted a cross-sectional methodology. More recently researchers have  adopted a longitudinal approach, measuring location image either side  of an event. However this ideally involves interviewing the same individuals at both time points (e.g.  Herz & Arnegger, 2017a, 2017b ;  Sun  & Paswan, 2012 ), a possible explanation for the lack of such studies  ( Lee, Kim, Lee, & Kim, 2014 ). Here the same citizens of Colombia (91),  Austria (50) and Peru (66) were interviewed one month before and  again one month after the 2014 World Cup. This allows us to test our  hypotheses directly and by doing so examine the effects of the event at  the level of the individual. Respondents to the first survey who agreed  were sent a further questionnaire and their responses matched to their  initial data not only by matching the email address but also by ensuring  that the demographic information was the same on both questionnaires.  The survey was conducted online in Spanish or German using a convenience sample in all cases.  There are options for measuring country image which divide into  two broad groups, cognitive and affective. In the former respondents  are asked, for example, about how democratic they believe the country  to be or about its standard of living (see for example  Giraldi,  Maheshwari, Mariutti, & Konstantopoulou, 2017 ). More affective  measures include that of the NBP and we used measures of both types.  Our more cognitive measure was of ‘overall attitude’ from  RojasMéndez, Murphy, et al. (2013) . For the affective measures, and following  Davies, Rojas-Méndez, Whelan, Mete, and Loo (2018)  we focused on three ‘core’ dimensions of NBP, Warmth (e.g. trustworthy and  friendly), Competence (e.g. skilful and enterprising), and Status (e.g.  sophisticated and elegant). Our measurement items for these and for  tourism intentions were taken from  Rojas-Méndez, Papadopoulos, and  Murphy (2013) . In addition to asking for demographic information,  such as age, gender and education, we included measures of respondent  personality ( Gosling, Rentfrow, & Swann Jr., 2003 ) and attitude towards football ( Beasley & Shank, 1998 ). We also included questions  about frequency of watching football. The second questionnaire (sent  after the event) contained an additional question designed to assess the  valence of news the respondent had read about the World Cup. Each  respondent was exposed to a randomly ordered list of the same questions. All measures and their reliabilities are given in the Appendix. ',\n",
              " '2. Methods  2.1. Study site  The present study focused on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, in the  Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and  Yucatan and the Mexican Caribbean Sea in the state of Quintana Roo  ( Fig. 2 ). The Mexican Gulf and Caribbean coasts are micro tidal; with  ranges of less than 0.62 m, and wave processes are the primary agents  of morphodynamic changes and sediment transport ( Silva et al., 2008 ).  The climate is semiarid in the northern state of Tamaulipas and humid  subtropical in the other five states.  Historically, the coastal and marine ecosystems on the Gulf of  Mexico and the Caribbean have had high ecological and socioeconomic  value. The biological diversity along these coasts is high, and a rich  array of ecosystems are present, including mangroves, wetlands, seagrass beds, coral reefs, coastal lagoons, coastal dunes, sandy and rocky  beaches ( Martínez et al., 2017 ;  Silva et al., 2014 ). Human activities  such as commercial trade and fishing have taken place along these  coasts for centuries ( Martínez et al., 2017 ;  Propín-Frejomil & SánchezCrispín, 2007 ). In many cases, tourism activities have led to the loss or  degradation of natural ecosystems, negatively affecting the provision of  ecosystem services, such as scenic beauty, recreation and shoreline  protection ( Everard, Jones, & Watts, 2010 ).  2.2. Procedure  We assessed the co-occurrence of coastal tourism and coastal  squeeze as follows ( Fig. 3 ). First, we located all the tourist destinations  in the study area and assessed the intensity of tourism activities in terms  of infrastructure (hotels). This was a proxy of urbanization. Second,  coastal squeeze was assessed by using intersections among the cartographic representations of three parameters: the need for ecosystems to  migrate inland, the actual possibility of inland migration and the longterm coastal sustainability of urban development in terms of flood risk  ( Table 1 ). The calculations for all the variables are described below.  2.2.1. Tourism intensity  Tourist sites on a 10-km-wide coastal belt were geo-localized for  each state. Five categories were selected for each littoral cell ( Table 1 ),  from no tourism to high intensity tourism. A low number of hotels does  not necessarily reflect a low capacity of tourist accommodation or low  tourism pressure because a single hotel may have many rooms. So, the  number of hotel rooms was also considered, as massive all-inclusive  resorts have proliferated along the Mexican Caribbean coast. Thus, a  new data layer from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography  (INEGI) showing the number of rooms per location was overlaid on the  tourism destinations studied. Those sites labeled as low tourism (with a  reduced number of hotels) but with more than one thousand rooms  were re-labeled as medium intensity category.  2.2.2. Coastal squeeze  Coastal squeeze was determined with a GIS-based model. Three  parameters reflecting the probability of coastal squeeze were selected:  the need for ecosystems to migrate inland, the actual possibility of inland migration, and the long-term coastal sustainability (flood risk)  ( Table 1 ).  a) Need to migrate  The need of ecosystems to migrate inland depends on different local  attributes of the coast: a decreased resistance to disturbance owing to  fragmentation; a decreased resilience, which is indirectly determined  by an erosion threshold, and the capacity of protection provided by  natural ecosystems. It was calculated based on the estimated impact of  disturbance variables (flood risk, erosion, and storms) that could force  ecosystems to migrate inland. When assessing the need to migrate we  considered coastal resistance and resilience as follows.  Decreased resistance Resistance was considered as the capacity of  an ecosystem to deal with perturbations (remain unchanged) and was  determined according to the geological and ecological attributes of  coastal ecosystems ( Liquete et al., 2013 ). Coastal resistance was considered as a measure of the state of conservation of an ecosystem, assuming that a decline in vegetation cover can affect the capacity to trap  sediments and increase sand erosion ( Pontee, 2013 ). Fragmentation  was therefore considered to reflect a decrease in ecosystem resistance.  Maps of the occurrence and degree of perturbation of mangrove and  coastal  dune  ecosystems  from  previous  works  were  considered  ( CONABIO 2016 ;  Martínez et al., 2014b , p. 350). Both diagnostics were  national maps produced using high-resolution remote sensing data, field work and aerial photographs. We focused on coastal ecosystems  (mangroves and coastal dunes) and created maps with their conservation status, based on information previously generated, as explained  below.  2.2.3. Mangrove perturbation  In the Mexican Atlas of mangroves ( CONABIO, 2016 ) it is estimated  that this ecosystem covers a total area of 770,057 ha, in a 1:50,000  scale. The perturbation map of the Atlas was produced mainly from  multispectral images of the SPOT-5 satellite (10 m spatial resolution)  from 2015. Then, digital elevation models (2015), vegetation indexes  and field data were used to classify the images. Finally, the map was  validated through an extensive field campaign and helicopter over- flights by the Secretary of Mexican Marine Defense, always accompanied by experts on mangrove vegetation. The country was divided in five regions (Gulf of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Pacific,  Central Pacific and South Pacific) and nine classes (anthropic development, crop and animal husbandry, other vegetation types, unvegetated, mangrove, disturbed mangrove, other wetlands, water  bodies, other). To achieve the goals of this study, two regions were  selected (Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Peninsula) and two land use  classes (mangrove and perturbed mangrove). The layer of perturbed  mangrove was overlapped with a map of infrastructure. The final three  classes ranged from conserved mangroves to highly perturbed areas  ( Table 1 ).  2.2.4. Coastal dunes perturbation  Martínez et al. (2014b)  performed a national diagnostic of Mexican  coastal dunes. Google Earth images were used to digitalize and classify  coastal dunes. First, the authors regionalized Mexican coasts into five  areas (North Pacific, Gulf of California, South Pacific, Gulf of Mexico  and Yucatan Peninsula). Then, coastal dune systems were digitized, and  the conservation status of each system was determined according to  land use, inhabited areas (from villages to cities), density of roads and  highways, as well as all the elements that may cause dune fragmentation (a description of the five levels of conservation status is shown in  Table 1 ).  Decreased resilience .  In this study, resilience was defined as the  capacity of ecosystems to respond to disturbances and retain the essential structures, processes, and feedbacks ( Martínez et al., 2017 ).  When ecosystems are resilient, the adaptive capacity of society to the  increasing risk from natural hazards is increased ( Jones, Hole, &  Zavaleta, 2012 ;  Reid, 2016 ). Because sediment dynamics play a key role  in the natural dynamics of coastal ecosystems, we measured resilience  in terms of changes in the sediment erosion threshold, based on  revious studies.  2.2.5. Changes in sediment erosion threshold  This variable refers to changes in sediment erosion threshold owing  to the impact of badly-planned infrastructure on the natural hydrosedimentary dynamics of the coast.  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares  (2004)  used multi-temporal information from satellite images (LIDAR  1986 to 2013) and field verification to classify Mexican coasts according to their geodynamic behavior and vulnerability to erosion. The  authors defined the instability tendency of the Mexican coastline as a  function of internal geodynamic processes (tectonic characteristics,  vertical movements of ground) and external geodynamic processes  (hydrological and hydrographic characteristics of the fluvial and estuarine network). Then,  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares (2004)  proposed a classification of the Mexican coasts as follows: erosive, mixed or  accumulative. That classification was modified by  Silva et al. (2014) ,  who added further external geodynamic processes (wave height,  period, extreme wave heights, grain size, sediment supply, bathymetry), anthropogenic actions (hydrosedimentary interruption), the  interactions among these factors and their relationship with erosion  trends and velocity.  Silva et al. (2014)  used aerial photographs (from  1975 to 2014) to analyze historical coastline position, satellite images  to identify hydrosedimentary interruptions, mathematic models to describe national wave climate and field work to validate the information.  The new coastal geodynamic classification of Mexico ( Silva et al., 2014 )  includes the velocity of coastal changes and considers five categories in  response to natural and artificial drivers: slowly prograding, rapidly  prograding, stable, slowly erosive, and very erosive ( Table 1 ). We thus  used the velocity of coastal changes (slow, none, fast) as a measure of  resilience: faster changes were assumed to represent a reduced resilience. Obviously, when shoreline evolution is negative (erosion), it is  hazardous for human infrastructure.  2.2.6. Natural protective capacity  Natural coastal ecosystems attenuate waves in normal conditions  and during storm events, reduce storm surge waves and promote sediment deposition and retention. In consequence, coastal ecosystems  help to protect the coasts from flooding and erosion. The effectiveness  of such protection depends on coastal geomorphology and the type of  ecosystem (depending on physical attributes such as the surface  roughness or the frictional resistance, related with the degree of conservation, the size of the ecosystem, the vegetation density and stiffness).  Coastal geomorphology: The occurrence of erosion and flooding  largely depends on coastal geomorphology. This information was  gathered from topographic and geological maps by  Silva et al. (2014) .  The natural protective capacity of each geomorphological type found  on the coast was classified following  Liquete et al. (2013)  which was  modified to better fit our study sites ( Table 1 ).  Coastal habitat resistance: This variable reflects the physical resistance of each coastal ecosystem to any potential environmental  change in sediment or wave energy dynamics (e.g. waves during actual  and future storm events) attributed to its ecological attributes. We  classified the Coastal habitat resistance according to the frequency and  level of exposure to energy (wave and flooding) under prevailing and  extreme conditions. In addition, the condition of the fragility of each  ecosystem was considered to generate the ranking in resistance  ( Table 1 ).  b) Migration possibility  Migration possibility was assessed based on the premise that coastal  ecosystems can migrate inland when they are well preserved and  functional, and there are no physical obstacles (natural or human-induced) that interrupt such processes. In consequence, we considered  that the inland migration of an ecosystem depends on the type of coast  (with cliffs totally blocking any inland migration) and is negatively  affected by coastal infrastructure and urban growth. Therefore, the  variables used for this assessment included type of coastline (see  Table 1 ) ( Silva et al., 2011 ) and the occurrence of rigid barriers that  could either directly block migration or disrupt hydro-sedimentary  dynamics and increase erosion ( Rangel-Buitrago, Williams, & Anfuso,  2018 ).  Type of coast was used as a proxy of migration capacity based on the  theory of environmental filtering, which states that environmental  stress factors (sand movement, soil salinity, etc.) are filters that determine the presence of tolerant or non-tolerant species in a specific  site, given the predominant environmental conditions. These species  are gathered, according to their tolerances, into functional traits that  are useful to predict community behavior and possible responses to  changes ( Gallego-Fernández & Martínez, 2011 ). It was thus assumed  that plants growing on naturally erosive beaches are usually adapted to  salinity and burial by sand and can even be dispersed by sea-water.  Hence, it is expected that these plants will have a high natural capacity  for landward migration as the salinity increases inland owing to SLR. In  turn, when the beach is eroding artificially and rapidly, non-tolerant  and mainly inland species are present, and the possibility of migration  is reduced.  For each sedimentary cell, and from the shoreline up to 100 m inland, image analyses using Arc Map 10.2 was used to map the occurrence of coastal infrastructure (rigid barriers, perpendicular to the  shoreline or located on the waterfront), considering their spatial location, number, and type (breakwaters, groins, and ports). Finally, the  degree of rigidity of each sedimentary cell was estimated by combining  the type of coast and the occurrence of coastal infrastructure on the  beach, on top of, or behind the dune systems, according to  Pranzini  et al. (2015) .  c) Long-term sustainability (Flood risk and SLR)  The long-term sustainability of a coastal site is largely affected by  sea level rise and flood risk (caused by heavy rains and storm surges).  The location of such flood-prone areas was based on previous work by  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares (2004) , who performed a geomorphological analysis of the Mexican coasts. First, they divided the coasts  of Mexico into geomorphic units, and then they performed a coastal  zonation with aerial imagery (1943, 1975, 1986 and 1997), a videography,  ∼ 1 m ground resolution (1997), and topographic maps (1:  10,000) from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI)  and terrain data from ground surveys. The zoning was based on variables that considered internal geodynamic processes (tectonics and  subsidence; local subsidence), external geodynamic processes (historical shoreline variations), hydrometeorological factors (mean significant wave height), and vegetation zones. The authors assumed that  belts of different vegetation types (e.g. herbaceous wetland, mangrove,  etc.) result from differences in flooding tolerance and hence, flood  permanence. Maps showing the vulnerability to fluvial and coastal flooding were generated by combining the above-mentioned geomorphological zoning with slope, elevation and historical flooding events  (by storm surges and surface runoff). The flood vulnerability was  completed by including low-lying lands that are normally dry, but  which had been flooded in the past by either seawater or surface runoff.  Finally, we uploaded all the information in a GIS-based model with  which the map of potentially inundated areas exposed to 1 m of SLR  was generated. To achieve this, we combined the coastal zoning of flood-prone areas with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) following the  same methods as  Villatoro et al. (2014) . The coastal flooding map that  we used combined both sea level rise and flood risk (caused by heavy  rains and storm surges).  To characterize the probability of flooding by storm surge for the  states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan and  Quintana Roo,  Arriaga, Durán, Posada, Silva, and de Brye (2010) , used  the hybrid model Mato-HURAC ( Posada, Silva, & de Brye, 2008 ) and  the database of the Atlantic Mexican Atlas of maritime climate ( Silva  et al., 2008 ) modeled numerically the 117 hurricanes that arrived at the  Mexican coasts between 1949 and 2009.  Following  Villatoro et al. (2014) , for all the entire Mexican Atlantic  coast we obtained the maximum storm surge per year. Flood-prone  areas were delineated based on estimated storm surge and using the  same method  Villatoro et al. (2014)  used in which the authors explored  the vulnerability to flooding and erosion using a range of variables  (topography, bathymetry, climate) in the model projections and risk  analysis tools. The data thus obtained was ordered annually from  highest to lowest and a Weibull type probability adjustment was used.  For the present study, the data corresponding to a storm surge with a  100-year probability of occurrence were used.  2.3. Calculating coastal squeeze: criteria followed for normalization and  aggregation of variables  The analysis of the indicators to be included in the coastal squeeze  index depend on the data resolution availability and the spatial operations rely on the nature of the data. The spatial analysis to extract  each indicator included the homogenization of geographic projection in  each dataset, the transformation of raster information to polygons and  the intersection of those polygons with each littoral cell polygon.  Hence, a single value, per indicator per littoral cell, was obtained. Then,  for each littoral cell, the score of each variable described in  Table 1  was  normalized by using the max-min method, as shown in Equation  (1) .  (1)  These normalized indicators were aggregated within each criterion  ( i.e . importance of tourism, need to migrate, migration possibility and  long-term sustainability) using arithmetic means (Eq.  (2) ).  (2)  Then, the four criteria scores were aggregated into the coastal  squeeze index ( i.e.  across criteria) with a geometric mean (Eq.  (3) ).  (3)  where Tourism Importance ( α ); Need to Migrate ( β ); Migration Possibility ( γ ) and Long-term Sustainability ( δ ) are the four criteria calculated by the aggregation of the standardized values for the variables  listed in  Table 1 , namely: Occupation intensity ( a ); Resistance ( b );  Resilience ( b ); Natural migration ( c ); Rigidization ( c ); Future conditions ( d ) and; Unsuitable conditions ( d ).  Finally, coastal squeeze values were normalized into a zero  –  one  range, with the higher scores representing more intense coastal  squeeze. ',\n",
              " '3. Methodology  Given that research on tourist harassment is fragmented and immature, a qualitative study approach was deemed appropriate for the  current investigation. To explore the influence of tourist harassment on  travelers ’  perceived destination image, their expenditure, and their  behavioral intentions, in-depth interviews with international travelers  visiting Petra, Jordan were conducted.  After a series of open-ended questions were identified, an expert  panel of three university colleagues was asked to critically review the  questions and provide feedback. The questions were also pilot tested on  three tourists following their visit to Petra. The expert panel, as well as  the tourists, agreed that the questions were well-structured and comprehensible, thus no changes were made. The survey consisted of two  sections; the first section aimed to collect demographic as well as tripographic data whereas as the second section included ten open-ended  questions with the aim to understand informants ’  experiences with  harassment in the destination and to explore as to whether these experiences influenced their perceptions and behaviors. The interviews  were conducted by one of the authors who was born and raised about 4  miles away from the heritage site of Petra. Thus, the interviewer was an  outsider in that he was not a member of the study population ( Kanuha,  2000 ). Yet, as a native of the destination, he had deep knowledge of the  study setting. Given the sensitivity of the research topic, the interviewer  introduced himself as a faculty member doing academic research in the field of tourism. Moreover, informants were guaranteed complete  confidentiality and anonymity and were given the option to terminate  the interview at any point. To ensure that interviews were of good  quality, the interviewer made sure that informants were not in rush and  that they had su ffi cient time to dedicate to the interview. Moreover, the  interviewer allowed informants to narrate their experiences without  interference. Thus, a phenomenological approach rather than a directive approach was adopted.  Interviews were conducted over a period of five weeks from  December 28, 2017 till February 4, 2018. Despite its limitation, a  convenience sampling approach was employed given the time limitation and the di ffi culty in recruiting informants for the relatively unfavorable weather conditions by the time of data collection. Informants  were approached in different places including the Petra Visitor Center  and hotel lobbies. As screening criteria, informants should i) be 18 year  or older, ii) have visited the archeological site of Petra, and iii) have  spent at least one night in the destination. In total, 41 travelers were  randomly approached and 27 of them accepted to participate in the  study. Although 30 interviews were initially planned, authors agreed  that the saturation level had been reached and thus conducting further  interviews would not add much more insights ( Glaser & Strauss, 1967 ).  Given that most travelers were in groups of family, friends, or  package tours, and to ensure capturing different experiences, the interviewer was aware that no more than one informant from the same  group should be interviewed. All the interviews were conducted in  English language and digitally recorded with the consent of the informants. On average, each interview lasted about 30 min. The interviews were verbatim transcribed right after each interview and nonverbal clues were also recorded. The interview transcriptions were read  independently by authors several times. Authors addressed the data  inductively while also being aware of the body of knowledge of tourist  harassment. By doing so, a hybrid approach of data-driven and theorydriven content analysis was employed ( Fereday & Muir-Cochrane,  2006 ). Finally, authors reached a consensus on extracted themes and findings. Along with the conventional content analysis, word frequency  analysis was performed using NVivo 12 to draw a word cloud of the  most mentioned words in the interviews. In the case of the present  study, complete reliance on software-based analysis may not provide  the creativity and intelligence that features qualitative inquiry ( Patton,  2002 ). The e ffi ciency of NVivo in emphasizing the manual handling of  data is also acknowledged ( Sotiriadou, Brouwers, & Le, 2014 ). Therefore, the word cloud is used only to support the conventional data  analysis adopted in the present study. ',\n",
              " \"3. Methods  Current literature on cross-cultural tour groups inclines towards  positivist or post-positivist paradigms ( Kwek & Lee, 2010 ;  Wang &  Davidson, 2010a ,  2010b ;  Wang, Weaver, et al., 2016 ) informed by a  priori principles lacking su ffi cient context to capture the complex attendant cultural dynamics. Alternatively, a social constructivist paradigm can capture the latter by de-emphasizing researcher assumptions  about such lived experiences and through recognition of duality and  subjectivity allowing for the construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of meaning ( Jennings, 2010 ). Lived experiences allow us  to develop insider perspectives by providing vivid and descriptive accounts of those who live the experience. We were thus able to better  interpret these experiences and gain meaningful understanding of the  phenomenon ( Mapp, 2008 ;  Pernecky & Jamal, 2010 ). Such an interpretive approach permits identification and understanding of decisionmaking processes and lived experiences of tour group members in a  Western or non-Western context ( Phillmore & Goodson, 2004 ).  Recent studies of face in tourism embody the importance of immersive qualitative approaches, due to their explanatory power and  proximity to informants ( Kwek & Lee, 2013 ;  2015 ). Because face relies  heavily on discourse and language, they can provide important narrative insights beyond the hypothesis testing privileged by quantitative  analysis (e.g. face gained or lost) and better capture the rich feelings  and reactions of both tour group members and researchers. Hence, data  were collected through participant observation, casual discourse, notetaking, and diary-keeping. Such diverse techniques increase perceptivity of environment and social relationships within the complex,  subjective and multi-dimensional nature of tourism ( Buckley, 2012 ),  and enable triangulation through constant construct refinements and  cross-comparisons.  Consequently, two of the three researchers (Fieldwork researchers 1  and 2, or FR1 and FR2) participated in tour groups to China for overseas  Chinese. To triangulate this case, they initially participated in different  tours (A & B) then participated in two tours together (C & D), over a  four year period from 2011 to 2015. Through integration into these  tours where they conducted independent observations, an emic perspective was gained. FR1 participated in a nine-day Beijing-Shanghai  overland tour (A) involving 26 residents of Australia and Indonesia of  Chinese ethnicity. FR2 participated in Tour B, an eight-day tour focused  on Beijing with 33 participants mostly China- or Taiwan-born but  currently resident overseas (i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand or  United States). Tour C had a similar itinerary to Tour A, but with a  different membership profile consisting of 37 Chinese participants from  Western and Southeast Asian countries. Tour D was a regional tour  covering Shanghai and several surrounding cities, with 17 participants  rimarily from Mainland China and currently residing in Australia and  Canada. These samples conveniently captured diasporic Chinese of  varying Chinese language proficiency and cultural understanding from  key geographic locations (see  Appendix 1 ). Priced below operational  costs, all tours recuperated costs though exposure to intensive shopping  at designated venues ( Wang et al., 2016 ). This context was crucial to  interpreting observed behavior, as participants and intermediaries were  pressured, respectively, to buy and sell featured products.  The researchers used covert observations owing to negative publicity of low cost tours, wherein disclosure may incite abuses from  implicated tour operators. We observed tourist interactions with each  other and service intermediaries, as well as associated spatial, temporal  and social contexts. While not possible to observe all such interactions  at all times, the two participant-researchers maintained an attitude of  continual alertness, and were especially vigilant during times of group  congregation such as at target attractions, on the tour bus, and during  meals. Casual conversations with individuals or small groups were also  initiated at opportune times, as warranted, to obtain clarity on observed  dynamics. Covertness, while by necessity imposing a power imbalance  between observer and observed, was considered necessary as the phenomenon is public but provides participant anonymity ( Holloway,  Brown, & Shipway, 2010 ). Covert observations in other settings such as  nude beaches ( Andriotis, 2010 ), premarital stag tours ( Thurnell-Read,  2012 ), and children's shelters ( Tomozos & Butler, 2012 ) have been similarly justified. By concealing our identities, we could immerse ourselves without influencing participant behavior. Partially redressing the  issue of power imbalance, tour group members were notified of our  identity as university researchers and when questioned, we divulged  our academic interest in Chinese group tours without revealing any  specificity of interest. We could thus detect participant motivations and  observe relevant interactions while complying with university's ethics  protocol as well as government legislation. Both fieldwork researchers  kept a diary for each tour in which they participated, and entries were  made at the end of each day of the tours.  To better understand our interpretations, disclosure of researcher(s)  contexts is necessary ( Caelli, Ray, & Mill, 2008 ). Being ethnic Chinese,  both fieldwork researchers were able to play an  ‘ insider ’  role to allow  for better in-depth qualitative research due to their cultural proximity  to the observed phenomenon ( Chang (2009) ). FR1 arrived in Australia  from Singapore in 1998. Her research expertise is drawn from her industrial and academic careers focusing on Chinese tourism. Being of  Chinese heritage with a Westernised education assists her in understanding both her current and original cultures. FR2 is familiar with  both Chinese and Western cultures, as she grew up in Mainland China,  studied in the United Kingdom, and migrated to Australia in 2001. Both  relied on their cultural heritage and anticipated varying levels of  facework in the tours, as subsequently established. Researcher 3, of  European heritage who migrated to Australia from Canada, guided the  theoretical and analytical phases of this research. All three researchers  have resided in Australia for an extended period of time and hence  acknowledge that their interpretations may be contaminated by Eurocentric Australian values.  Data were compiled in six detailed travel diaries (i.e., the three  tours undertaken by each of the two participant-researchers) with relevant observations and self-reflections supplemented by unstructured fieldwork conversations involving almost all other tour group members,  allowing for comprehensive exploration of attendant cultural practice  and values ( Silverman, 2001 ). We sought information on participants'  background (e.g., birth place, trip purpose and frequency, resident  country, and views on face) through casual conversations. This is crucial to our reflexivity, especially when a priori assumptions exist  ( Anderson, 2006 ;  Tribe, Xiao, & Chambers, 2012 ;  Tribe & Xiao, 2011 ).  Reflexivity guides theory development by extending existing theory  with the incorporation of new findings. Authenticity and credibility  were strengthened through observations by two fieldwork researchers  across four tour groups/six observed experiences ( DeBerry-Spence,  2010 ). Limitations of our observations are: (i) likely prioritization of  participants ’  perception at the expense of self-understanding, (ii) potentially missing of ambiguous but meaningful events by prioritizing  persistently occurring events and, (iii) compromising critical analysis  when developing personal relationships with participants ( Drew,  Hardman, & Hart, 1996 ). Consequently, we practiced continual selfreflection, member-checking and cross-checking to minimize these  limitations ( Jennings, 2010 ).  Data interpretation proceeded through thematic analysis, which  allows continual clarification of emerging themes and supports crossanalytical validation. Ultimately, a verdict of theoretical saturation  resulted once no new insights emerged; additional data, however, aided  in expanding the details of these revealed themes. For ethical reasons,  pseudonyms were used in result reporting. Moreover, tour group  members under 18 were excluded as they were travelling with their  parents and as such may have been shielded from facework participation or consequences, create an issue of parental consent that is not well  addressed in covert research of this nature, represent an amplified case  of power asymmetry, and constituted in any case only a very small  percentage of total tour group participants. To ensure goodness-of-fit,  authenticity and minimal bias, FR1 and FR2 independently identified,  coded, and grouped data into themes ( Corbin & Strauss, 2008 ). This  involved open-coding texts, then grouping resultant  open codes  through  axial coding to create structural meaning ( Fig. 2 ). This coding technique involves a process of analysis from concrete materials to abstract  meanings. It is an effective approach for systematic interpretation of  qualitative data with a purpose of theory generation, highly suitable for  constructivist approaches ( Corbin & Strauss, 2008 ). For example, we  identified in the open codes how members within groups exert pressure  on others to purchase souvenirs in order to deflect their own pressure  (please see Section  4.2 , Quadrant 4 for the context of this specific exchange). This exchange was deduced into a set of axial codes as shown  in  Fig. 2 . These codes reflect the within-group and public nature of the  attack and resulting loss of the attacker's face ( Lian ). Similarly, our  second example illustrates a case of reciprocal attack in public which  results in loss of face ( Lian  and  Mianzi ) for both parties involved (see  Section  4.1 , Quadrant 6). Through constant comparison, key themes  emerged ( reflective codes ). This progressive approach utilized triangulation by (i) source –  i.e., cross-comparing themes generated from fieldwork data collected from multiple trips by two researchers over a  four-year period and, (ii) analyst  –  i.e., cross-comparing findings generated by both researchers ( Patton, 1999 ). The references to  ‘ we ’  that  follow embrace all three authors. When quoting, aliases are used to  protect informant identities.  Appendix 2  presents details on the list of  data sources quoted in the following result section. \",\n",
              " '3. Method  Given the exploratory nature of this research, a qualitative approach  was adopted to acquire rich knowledge of the effects of front desk  technology. A major hotel chain recently implemented a new webbased front desk software system developed in 2017 by the corporation  IT team with the active engagement of employees. The new technology  integrates several systems, including property management, central  reservation, sales management, reward systems management, and  communication. Because it was a new technology that had been in  operation just over one year, it provided an opportunity to assess  management response to the technology innovation and its implications  for customer service.  Based on discussions with the corporate senior vice president for  technology, six open-ended interview questions (see  Appendix A ) were  used for acquiring process, output, and experiential archetype data; the  systemic archetype was explored by assessing the relationships across  the three archetypes.  The study population was hotel managers, including general managers, lodging operations managers, and front desk supervisors, from a  major USA hotel chain. Since the purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the new front desk technology on overall hotel  operations, only manager level employees were targeted. Using  Qualtrics, these managers were invited to answer six open-ended interview questions; providing up to three responses to each question.  Study respondents were recruited via an email study advertisement sent  by the hotel corporate o ffi ce to the selected managers at each hotel  property, asking them to voluntarily participate in the study; a link to  the Qualtrics survey was embedded in the advertisement. After one  week, a follow-up reminder email was sent also by the hotel corporate  o ffi ce. The survey advertisements were distributed to 600 hotel managers around the world; 251 respondents completed the survey (41.8%  response rate). Survey participation was voluntary; no financial compensation was made for participation.  The answer texts for the six questions resulted in 1,621 response  comments, comprising 26,058 words. Following the approach by  Creswell and Clark (2017)  and  Wong and Wickham (2015) , three-step  thematic analysis was conducted for each question using the qualitative  analysis tool, Nvivo (version 11) software package. In the first open  coding stage, each answer text was divided into small units, such as  phrase, sentence, or paragraph depending on the content of the transcription to explore the underlying concept. To increase inter-coder  reliability, 100 answer texts for each question were first coded independently by two coders, the authors; similarities and differences  were discussed to reach agreement on the coding rules and codes  ( Wong & Wickham, 2015 ). After that, the remaining answer texts were  fully coded. Following axial coding processes, the first-order codes were  categorized into second-order codes ( Wang, Hung, & Huang, 2019 ). For  example, in answers for the process-archetype question, data-coded  “ gets them checked in quickly ”  and  “ it is quick to update an email  address on a member profile upon check out. ”  were categorized as  “ Speed ” . Lastly, the second-order codes were gathered into aggregate  themes. For instance,  “ Speed ”  and  “ Integrative System ”  were gathered  as  ‘ E ffi ciency ” . All results were compared again and 5.6% of results  were discrepant between the coders. These discrepant results were recoded again after discussions between the coders. Lastly, the third author who has conducted and published several qualitative research  projects checked and refined the analysis and theme categories.  Included in the survey were a series of profile questions ( Table 1 ).  Among the responses, 45.7 percent were from managers at full-service  hotel and 54.3 percent were from select-service hotels. Of the hotels,  54.6 percent were brand-managed and 45.4 percent brand-franchised.  Of the respondents, 34.4% were general managers; 32.6% were front  o ffi ce manager/supervisors, and 27.9% were directors of operations/  assistant general managers. In terms of industry experience, 39.2 percent had more than 16 years of hotel management experience. Focusing  on the specific hotel, 14.3% reported working in their current hotel  more than 16 years, and 37.8% had 5 years or less experience in the  hotel. The discrepancy between the total number of interviews and the  combined number of participants in each demographic factor is derived  from some missing answers on demographic questions. ',\n",
              " 'The EPU index captures  the string of words in the newspaper articles such as  “ uncertain ”  or  “ uncertainty ” ;  “ economy ”  or  “ economic ” . Similarly, the GPR index is  constructed using the following word string:  “ war ” ,  “ terrorism ” ,  “ military ” ,  “ geopolitics ” . The time-trends of GPR and EPU are exhibited  in  Fig. 1 .  Methodologically, we follow a two-step process. In the first step, we  examine the relationship of tourist arrivals with GPR and EPU using the  wavelet coherence technique. This analytic tool eradicates some limitations of the traditional econometric techniques and facilitates a timefrequency based analysis. The wavelet coherence may be mathematically expressed as:  (1)  In the next step, we use the Partial Wavelet Coherence (PWC) with a  purpose. It is quite apparent that the EPU and GPR indexes are expected  to include some common events. While the policy changes could induce  war-like situations on the one hand, the war-like events may also induce uncertainties in respect of the economic policies on the other.  Thus, we insulate the impact of EPU on GPR by partial-out procedure  and study the influence of pure GPR events on tourist arrivals and viceversa.',\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Samples  The traditional face-to-face and voice-to-voice contact between  employees and guests is changing. In today's workplace, many hotels  use automation technologies, such as self-service check-in kiosks and  mobile service requests, to minimize costs and maximize operations  efficiencies.  This  study was conducted  among luxury hotels in  Guangzhou, China, a major international metropolis and innovative  South China city. Guangzhou has become an international science and  technology innovation hub. Many hotels in this global city are taking  advanced technologies to a new level by introducing robots into guest  service roles. Accordingly, hotel employees in Guangzhou are subjected  to advanced technology pressures. Thus, Guangzhou luxury hotel employees were selected as the research participants. To generate samples,  one of the authors contacted human resources (HR) managers at 35  hotels from a list provided by the local tourism administration office to  seek their approval to participate in this study. A total of 12 hotel HR  managers agreed to participate in this study. These 12 properties were  all five-star rated ‘luxury’ hotels, offering the opportunity to interview  various employees from different positions within similar departments  or teams, offering the highest level of accommodations and guest services in Guangzhou.  A team of research assistants distributed surveys at random to employees beginning their work shifts once written permission was obtained from the top management of all hotel properties. A total of 550  questionnaires were distributed among these 12 hotels with ten properties receiving 46 surveys and two properties receiving 45 surveys. A  total of 468 valid, and useable responses were returned from these 12  hotel properties. The duty roster for each hotel as reported by the  human resource staff determined that about 80% of all total employees  at all 12 properties worked primarily in three departments representing  Food and Beverage, Housekeeping and the Front Office. Thus, 80 percent of the surveys, or 37 surveys out of 46 for the 10 hotel properties,  and 36 out of 45 surveys for the two other hotel properties were distributed to employees working in those three departments at random  during a one-week period in early 2018. The remaining 8 or 9 surveys  for each property were distributed at random to employees in various  other departments including engineering, maintenance, security, spa  and fitness following the same procedure. Because social desirability  bias could possibly affect the validity of the questionnaire since this  study attempted to collect socially sensitive data, participants were  required to return their completed questionnaires by ballot boxes to  further guarantee their anonymity. Results from this effort showed that  nearly 42 percent of those participants had at least a four-year university degree. The average age of all respondents was 31.2 years and  61.6 percent of all respondents held non-management jobs. Women  represented 52 percent of all respondents. In addition, the mean job  tenure for all participants was 2.5 years.  3.2. Measures  Initially, a total of 20 hotel employees were invited to participate in  a pilot survey that verified the survey questionnaire and identified any  ambiguities. Data were collected for five different measures: AI and  robotics awareness, perceived organizational support, competitive  psychological climate, turnover intention, and personal background  (see the  Appendix  for the complete questionnaire).  AI and robotics awareness.  Four items were taken and modified from  Brougham and Haar (2017) 's study to better align them within the  context of hotels. All AI and robotics awareness items were measured  using seven-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7  (strongly agree). Sample items included: “I think my job has a high risk  of bowing to automation and will be replaced by machines with AI” and  “I am quite pessimistic about my future in this hotel due to employees  ossibly being replaced by an artificial intelligence system”.  Perceived organizational  support. Eight items were adapted from  prior studies ( Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, & Sowa, 1986 ) and  modified to fit the study's hotel context. POS was measured using a  seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to  strongly agree (7). Sample items included: “Our hotel cares about the  voice of employees,” “Our hotel genuinely cares about each individual's  well-being,” and “I can get immediate assistance if I need it”.  Competitive psychological climate . Four scale items were taken from  Fletcher, Major, and Davis (2008)  with modified wording used to fit the  context of the research. Responses were given a seven point rating scale  (from strongly disagree = 1 to strongly agree = 7). Sample questions  included “The reward I receive depends upon my performance compared to my colleagues” and “Everyone wants to be recognized as a top  performer in this hotel”.  Turnover intention . A five-item scale developed by  Wayne, Shore,  and Liden (1997)  was used to measure turnover intention. Respondents  were asked to evaluate these five items on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from “strongly disagree = 1” to “strongly agree = 7”. For example, respondents were asked if they agreed that “I think it might be  time to seriously consider quitting”, or on the contrary, “I will not leave  my current position”.  3.3. Analyses  This study investigated cross-level relationships with POS and CPC  at the hotel level and AI and robotics awareness and turnover intentions  at the employee level. However, because there are methodological and  conceptual weaknesses for both analyses, hierarchical linear modeling  (HLM) was used to remedy the methodological biases and limitations.  As an example, using the individual level analysis with the disaggregation method could provide a biased estimate of standard errors,  whereas the statistical testing power could be seriously weakened by  using the aggregation method within the organizational level. Thus,  hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) software version 7.01 was used to  analyze this unique nature of the multilevel data.  3.4. Data aggregation  A two-level model was identified using an outcome variable to represent turnover intentions and two independent variables were used at  the hotel-level to represent the POS and CPC. The direct consensus  model was performed to assess POS and CPC; that is, to estimate the  within-group agreement in the employee's POS and CPC for each hotel  by aggregating the lower-level units to higher level variables. To justify  the suitability of aggregating POS and CPC at the hotel level, both γ and intra-class correlations (ICCs) were calculated. The γ  were 0.90  for POS and 0.83 for CPC, which were well above the recommended  threshold value of 0.7. Thus, the results do support the underlying assumption that employees within hotels generally agreed on their POS  and CPC. In addition, the ICC (1) was 0.19 and ICC (2) was 0.76  ( F  = 4.46,  p  < .001) for POS, the ICC (1) was 0.17 and ICC (2) was  0.70 ( F  = 3.04,  p  < .001), providing sufficient evidence for both  within-group agreement and between-group reliability. \",\n",
              " \"5. Method  The methodology used to analyze the extent to which two contrasting categories of rate parity related legislative events (the first  category of events consists of the passing of rate parity bans in multiple  European countries, and the second being the dismissal of the rate  parity lawsuit in the United States) might have an impact on the market  value of the hotel and OTA industries involves several steps, based on  McWilliams and Siegel (1997) .  The abnormal returns are estimated through an event study. Under  the tenets of the E ffi cient Market Hypothesis, given available information, stock returns fully reflect all information affecting a firm,  including expectations about anticipated performance. In other words,  the methodology incorporates investors ’  valuation of discounted future  economic flows. Because market value is determined by stock prices,  this widely accepted view holds that when new firm relevant information arises, it results in changes in market value of firms - or the  market value of the industry, when the multiple firms in the industry  are impacted. Regulatory shocks in the two-sided hotel booking market,  including the rate parity related legislative outcomes that we are interested in assessing should therefore manifest themselves in the form  of abnormal returns for the OTA and hotel industries, respectively.  This choice of methodology has several benefits compared to accounting based measures of performance (such as profits). Firstly, we  are better able to isolate effects than we would with backward-looking  accounting metrics. Also, stock returns are not as influenced by seasonality issues as accounting measures ( Nicolau & Sharma, 2019 ). In  addition, because stock returns reflect the discounted value of all future  economic flows and relevant information affecting, they serve as an  excellent estimate of true performance ( McWilliams & Siegel, 1997 ).  To be specific, the event study methodology follows different steps  to collect the data ( McWilliams & Siegel, 1997 ):  i)  Detection of the event dates and sample selection.  In this analysis, we  use two sets of event dates, one for the European case and the other  for the US case. The first set of event dates (consisting of dates  when rate parity bans were passed in Europe ) are therefore: January 9th, 2015 (Germany); July 9th, 2015 (France); December 9th,  2016 (Austria); August 2nd, 2017 (Italy); July 19th, 2018 (Belgium); and July 20th, 2018 (Sweden). All these dates mark the dates  when the legislations were passed in the European countries, even if  the legislation was to come into effect at a later date in each country.  However, because the methodology used here is a forward-looking  measure based on investor valuation of future economic costs and  benefits, one would expect that even if the actual law were to come  into effect at a later date, changes in market value would be best  reflected when the legislation was passed. Certainly, this would not  be the case when using accounting based performance metrics such  as profits, where it would be important to examine effects only after  the laws came into effect.  It is important to recall that  Nicolau and Sharma (2019)  have already studied the impact of European rate parity bans on hotels; consequently, for the European case, we focus not on the effects on hotels,  but on the effects on OTAs. The dataset of OTAs for which we assess  changes in market value resulting from the passing of these legislations  consists of the major global publicly traded OTAs: Booking Holdings  Inc., Priceline Group Inc., Expedia Group Inc., Trivago N.V., Tripadvisor, Liberty Expedia Holdings and CTrip.  The other event date consists of the date the rate parity lawsuit was  dismissed in the United States  –  February 18, 2014. For this event, we  examine both the effect on the previously listed major publicly traded  global OTAs as well as on all major hotels listed on U.S. exchanges  under the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) system in the Center  for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. The obtained publicly  traded hotel firms with useable data were assumed to constitute the  U.S. hotel industry for purposes of examining effects of the U.S. rate  parity lawsuit dismissal.  Because there is a high frequency of merger and acquisition activity  in the OTA industry, the actual list of OTAs was not identical for the set  of events that consist of the dates when the European countries passed  legislation banning rate parity. However, because we are interested in  making industry level conclusions rather than conclusions about individual firms, the differences in list of OTAs from event-to-event are  not of concern. There is of course a high frequency of merger and acquisition activity in the hotel industry too, but because hotel reactions  in the present study involve a single date  –  the U.S. dismissal of the rate  parity lawsuit  –  the mergers and acquisitions in the hotel industry are  not relevant.  ii)  Definition of the event window.  As new information might not be  obtained by all shareholders at the same time, we select a 7-day  event window to test for any excess returns i.e., the three days before and after ( − 3,+3) the announcement date. Shorter windows  are preferred because they are less likely to be contaminated by  confounding events ( McWilliams & Siegel, 1997 ). Additional abnormal returns may be detected with longer windows, however, we  would not be able to attribute with confidence those abnormal returns to the event(s) we are interested in assessing.  Indeed, it is also customary practice in the event study literature  ( MacKinlay, 1997 ;  McWilliams & Siegel, 1997 ) to allow for the possibility that the market may acquire some information prior to an announcement, and have some expectation regarding the event. If this  were indeed to happen, then the market is likely to react prior to the  actual announcement. When dealing with regulatory events such as  this, a reaction prior to the actual announcement may occur for instance  because investors have an understanding of the economic policy  “ tendency ”  of the government. In the European cases note also that the rate  parity bans were not simultaneously passed in all countries. As such, by  simply having observed the prior legal outcomes in other European  countries, investors might be able to predict the position an imminent  announcement might take. We therefore include in the event window a  small numbers of days leading up to each event.  iii)  Identification of potential confounding effects.  The third step tries to  identify other news items -not related to the rate parity news-that  might appear in the event window and that could have a confounding effect on the potential abnormal returns. In order to find  any possible confounding effects, we queried Dow Jones' Factiva  database which covers over 32,000 news sources for the 7-day  period that comprises each event window. Typically, in a study such  as this, confounding news items on event dates would result in the  exclusion of firms for those particular dates. However, given that no  relevant news publications are detected in the event windows that  we have used, the firms listed in step one are maintained.  iv)  Estimation of the market model . The estimation of the market model  allows us to calculate the  “ normal returns ” , so a period of 150 days  is established for such estimation. Estimates are made based on the  market model, defined as  where for firm  i  on day  t ,  R  defines the daily returns and  R  defines  market portfolio's returns based on the Center for Research in Security  Prices' (CRSP) value weighted index, which covers the NYSE, NYSE  American, NASDAQ, and ARCA exchanges. The parameter  α  describes  the returns on the shares of company  i  independent of the market,  whereas  β  refers to the sensitivity of returns of  i  to variations in the  market returns.  ɛ  represents the error term that follows the GARCH  type autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model with  ε  =  h η  and  ε / ε , ε ,  …  ∼ N(0,  h ) being identically and independently distributed and E( η ) = 0 and E( η ) = 1. The conditional  variance assumes the form  h  =  c  +  λ ε +  γ h where parameters  c ,  λ , and  γ  are to be estimated. Securities in our database for  which we had an insu ffi cient data to estimate the normal returns were  excluded from further analysis. Abnormal returns,  AR  for hotels and/  or OTAs, resulting from the two categories of legislative events are  obtained as  v)  Testing abnormal returns.  To analyze the impact of these legislative  events on share prices, the significance of these abnormal returns is  tested using  Giaccotto and Sfiridis' (1996)  jackknife test, which  computes the standardized abnormal returns (SAR) for each stock  j.  For a window length  L  and  N firms, this test is defined as  where  where  The advantage of this test is that it controls for event-induced variance and helps reduce estimation bias by jackknifing the SAR values.  For more specific nuances as to its calculation,  Giaccotto and Sfiridis  (1996)  provide a detailed step-by-step procedure. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Samples and data  This study used the hotels' operational data in New York (NY) and  California (CA) in the U.S. from STR reports. This study chose these two  states because they were the most popular states in terms of tourist  arrivals for the last 10 years in the U.S. (the National Travel and  Tourism Office's (NTTO) Visitor Arrivals Program (I-94 Record)). The  data was a perfectly balanced panel sample, which included total 389  hotels with 3890 observations from 2008 to 2017. The data set contained the two types of hotel categories according to their F&B offerings  (i.e., full-service versus limited-service hotels) and the six ranks (i.e.,  from the highest to the lowest: luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper  midscale, midscale, and economy hotels). The number of full-service  hotels was 207 with 1988 observations and the number of limitedservice hotels was 213 with 1902 observations. The luxury full-service  hotels were 40 with 399 observations while there is no luxury limitedservice hotel. The upper upscale full-service hotels were 97 with 944  observations and the upper upscale limited-service hotels were 15 with  46 observations. The upscale full-service hotels were 61 with 564 observations and the upscale limited-service hotels were 68 with 566  observations. The midscale limited-service hotels were 30 with 299  observations and the economy limited-service hotels were 92 with 920  observations (see  Fig. 1  &  Table 2 ).  3.2. Variables and models  There were five dependent variables in the models, which were  occupancy ((the number of rooms sold/the number of total available  rooms) x 100), average daily rate (ADR = total room revenue/the  number of rooms sold), revenue per available room (RevPAR = total  room revenue/the number of total available rooms), gross operating  profit per available room (GOPPAR = (total room revenue – total room  expense)/the number of total available rooms), and gross operating  profit (GOP = ((total room revenue – total room expense)/the room  revenue). After testing normality of distribution, this study used the  natural log of the variables: LogOccupancy [log (the number of rooms  sold/the number of total available rooms) x 100], LogADR [log (total  room revenue/the number of rooms sold)], LogRevPAR [log (total room  revenue/the number of total available rooms)], LogGOPPAR [log (total  room revenue – total room expense)/the number of total available  rooms], and GOP ratio [((total room revenue – total room expense)/the  room revenue)]. The independent variable was the proportion of F&B  employees' salary over rooms employees’ salary after logarization: Log  (F&B Salary/Room Salary). This study chose the comparative ratio of  employee salary between the F&B department and the rooms department because the labor cost was the most significant input for the F&B  department. For the control variables, LogADR (when a dependent  variable was LogOccupancy) or LogOccupancy (when a dependent  variable was LogADR), class (luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper  midscale, midscale and economy), location of hotels (urban, suburban,  and others), years of operation (Age), hotel size (largest, upper large,  large, upper middle, middle, and small based on the number of rooms),  administrative and general expense (Log (A&G/Total Revenue)), marketing expense (Log (Marketing/Total Revenue)), and year dummies  were included in the models. Here, class and hotel size were ordered  variables, which were treated as continuous variables but location was  a categorical variable with other areas as a base.  A random-effects regression was used because the models included  important time invariant variables, including location, the class of hotel  and the size hotel. The models were to examine how important the F&B  operating was in hotel business performance in the aspect of occupancy,  ADR, RevPAR, GOPPAR, and GOP ratio. The results of Breusch-Pagan/  Cook-Weisberg test ( Breusch & Pagan, 1979 ) for heteroskedasticity  indicated the variance were not homoscedastic (p-value < 0.001) and  Ramsey RESET test ( Ramsey, 1969 ) also showed that the errors were  autocorrelated (p-value < 0.001). To avoid these heteroscedasticity  issues, all models used the cluster-adjusted robust standard errors. The  first model was examined with all full-service hotels, luxury full-service  hotels, upper upscale full-service hotels, and upscale full-service hotels  separately to eliminate the effect of hotel class on occupancy, ADR,  RevPAR, GOPPAR, and GOP ratio.  Random-effects regression model:  Y  = β0 + β1* Log(F&B Salary/Room Salary)  + β2* LogADR or  LogOccupancy + β3*Class + β4*i.Location + β5*Age +  β6*Size  + β7*Log(A&G/Total Revenue)  + β8*Log(Marketing/Total  Revenue)  + ∑ year + γ +  ε\",\n",
              " \"3. Method  3.1. Measurement  Following a multi-stage procedure recommended by  Churchill  (1979)  and  DeVellis (2016) , a self-administrated survey was developed.  Based on an extensive literature review, an initial version of the survey  instrument was developed with accordance to the specific event context. These items were translated into Chinese using a double-translation procedure ( Brislin, 1970 ). A panel of five experts in related fields  was then invited to assess content validity. With small modifications,  the survey instrument was finalized and a bilingual version was used in  this study. Residents' community concern was measured using three  items adapted from  Gursoy and Kendall (2006)  and  Potter, Cantarero,  and Wood (2012) . Event attachment was measured on a three-item  scale from  Wood (2006) ,  Song et al. (2012)  and  Gursoy et al. (2017) .  QOL was operationalized using three items from  Kaplanidou et al.  (2013) . Resident's support for the event, as well as their perceptions of  the event impacts were measured using multiple items from  Ap and  Crompton (1998) ,  Gursoy, Kim, and Uysal (2004) ,  Gursoy and Kendall  (2006)  and  Gursoy et al. (2002) . All constructs were measured on a 7point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree and 7 = strongly agree), with  the exception of perceived QOL which was measured on a 5-point Likert  scale (1 = strongly disagree and 5 = strongly agree).  3.2. Data collection  To investigate residents’ post-evaluation of a sport event and  relevant perceptions as well as the hypothesized mental construal  change over time, the repeated cross-sectional (RCS) design was used in  this study. With the application of random sampling approach in each  data collection stage, a larger and more representative sample of the  population is expected to be reached using RCS design. Moreover, as a  collection of representative sample of a population or a specific group  level data over time, the RCS data structure has shown its superiority on  reflecting the dynamic nature of a population or a group components  and identifying changes in the relationships over time compared to the  cross-sectional design, as well as the operational ease compared to  panel studies ( Lebo & Weber, 2015 ). The RCS design has been commonly used in political science and related fields to investigate changes  in perceptions and attitudes, such as the investigation of opinion  changes in response to political and social events ( Green and Shapiro,  1996 ), or consumer confidence change ( De Boef and Kellstedt, 2004 ).  An increased application of RCS in the tourism domain, particularly in  exploring perceptual changes in evaluations of event impacts has also  been observed (e.g.  Chi et al., 2018 ;  Kaplanidou et al., 2013 ;  Gursoy  et al., 2011 ;  Li and Kaplanidou, 2013 ).  Two independent data collections were conducted with a 6-month  time interval. The first dataset, which was collected in May 2017, i.e.  three months after the 2017 SCHKM was labeled as the near-past group.  The second data collection, which was collected in October 2017, i.e.  eight months after the 2017 SCHKM was labeled as the distant-past  group. Each data collection session lasted for about two weeks.  Specifically, a group of trained student facilitators was recruited and  trained to administer the survey at selected high traffic public areas,  including shopping centers, community recreation, and sport centers,  and business districts. At each location, facilitators were instructed to  approach every tenth person passing through ( Gursoy & Kendall, 2006 ;  Gursoy et al., 2017 ). After briefly introducing the research purpose,  they, then, invited the approached subject to complete the survey. A  total of 1,873 responses were obtained with 892 from the first round of  data collection and 1,004 from the second data round of collection.  Prior to undertaking analyses, datasets were cleaned and screened for  incomplete responses as well as responses indicating non-residency in  Hong Kong, resulting in 882 and 991 valid responses from the two  rounds of data collection respectively.  3.3. Data analysis  The proposed model was tested twice using each dataset separately. Specifically, a two-stage structural equation modeling (SEM)  process ( Nunkoo, Ramkissoon, & Gursoy, 2013 ) using the Robust  Maximum Likelihood (MLR) estimation was employed to analyze the  data via the Mplus 7 package. At the first stage, a confirmatory factor  analysis (CFA) was performed to assess the properties of the measurement model for both samples. At the second stage, the structural  model was tested using both samples. In addition, aligning with  Preacher and Hayes (2004 ,  2008) ’ argument about the sampling  distribution problem faced with testing the indirect effects, this study  used bootstrapping to generate asymmetric confidence intervals to  assess the proposed indirect effects. The chi-square statistics and  other global fit indices suggested good model fits for the measurement models and structural models for both groups ( Nunkoo et al.,  2013 ).  Moreover, to address whether residents' perceptions and attitudes  regarding the event and their overall QOL has changed as a function of  time, series of simple t-tests were performed on each of the means of  latent variables between the near- and distant-past samples. Finally, to  examine the proposed variations in residents’ construct abstraction  regarding the evaluation of event impacts and overall life quality over  time, a multi-group analysis was conducted to test the structural invariance of paths in the proposed model between the near- and distant-past groups. Specifically, by constraining the hypothesized paths  among two groups to be equal, a series of multi-group modeling were  erformed. Using the baseline model which had no equality constrain  across groups as the reference, a Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square  difference test was then conducted to assess the differences between  each path between two groups. \",\n",
              " \"3. Method  3.1. Setting: the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup  Cricket is a popular sport throughout the countries of the British  Commonwealth ( Horne, 2010 ). The ICC, cricket's international governing  body, represents 105 countries and is responsible for the worldwide governance of the sport. The ICC stages many cricket events including the ICC  CWC, a quadrennial event that sees 10 national teams competing.  In 1998, keeping with its rotational system, the ICC awarded  hosting rights to the West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) for the 2007 ICC  CWC ( Horne, 2010 ). The WICB (since renamed as Cricket West Indies)  is the governing body for cricket in the West Indies. To deliver the  event, the WICB incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, ICC Cricket  World Cup West Indies 2007 Inc. (CWC 2007 Inc.)  CWC 2007 Inc. proposed seven objectives for hosting the CWC:  high-quality event management, brand legacy, infrastructure improvement, widespread economic opportunity, unique Caribbean promotion, regional integration, high profitability, and enhancement of the  international popularity of cricket ( ICC Cricket World Cup West Indies  2007 Inc., 2004 ).  3.2. The host nations of the 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup  The West Indies, also referred to as the Caribbean, is a crescentshaped archipelago that separates the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean  Sea to the west and south respectively, from the Atlantic Ocean to the  east and north. The chain of islands stretches from the peninsula of  Florida southeast to the north coast of Venezuela.  After a competitive bidding process, nine Caribbean countries were  selected to jointly host the event. The host countries were Antigua and  Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St.  Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. The  small size of the islands necessitated this co-hosting arrangement across  multiple island-states as no one island had the capacity, human and  otherwise, to deliver the entire event.  Importantly, Caribbean cricket is more than merely sport ( Beckles,  2004 ). Cricket in the Caribbean is believed to reflect “both the region's  colonial history and its post-colonial aspirations” ( Horne, 2010 , p.  1555) and is “most obviously touched by elements of carnival” ( Crabbe  & Wagg, 2000 , p. 70). The 2007 ICC CWC was heavily reported in the  media and through government documents and reports as being a  catalyst for economic and social development in the Caribbean and was  expected to produce a lasting positive legacy ( Jordan, 2011 ;  SinclairMaragh, 2011 ;  Tyson, Hayle, Truly, Ann Jordan, & Thame, 2005 ). In  preparation for the event, all nine host countries made significant investments. However, Barbados and Jamaica allocated the largest  amount of funds to host the event. The monies earmarked for the largescale event project represented significant portions of each nation's  national budget. The Government of Barbados allocated US$200 million of its budget, while the Government of Jamaica allocated US$105  million of taxpayers' money to host the event ( Bhagoo & Rambarran,  2006 ). The substantial investment was an indicator of the importance of  the event to the region and the event's projected role in acting as a  catalyst for development.  Barbados and Jamaica provide an ideal context for understanding  how the formalised regulations of the ICC influenced how the 2007 ICC  CWC was leveraged, given the strategic focus of both countries to utilise  the 2007 ICC CWC to realise specific benefits. Barbados is the easternmost Caribbean island, with an area of 430 square kilometres and a  population of approximately 292,336. It is the wealthiest country in the  Eastern Caribbean and has one of the highest per capita incomes in the  region ( Central Intelligence Agency, 2017 ;  Lorde, Greenidge, &  Devonish, 2011 ). Jamaica is the largest English-speaking Caribbean  island with an area of 10,991 square kilometres and a population of  2,990,561. The island is the birthplace of reggae music and has a mature tourism industry that dates back to 1891 ( Stupart & Shipley, 2012 ).  3.3. Data collection and analysis  Data were collected through 19 face-to-face in-depth interviews  with key tourism stakeholders and former members of the 2007 ICC  CWC local organising committees (LOCs) for Barbados and Jamaica.  Purposive and snowballing techniques were used to select respondents  who held key roles in delivering the event or who currently hold key  decision-making roles within the tourism sector ( Mason, 2002 ;  Patton,  2002 ). Nine of the participants were from Barbados and the other 10  participants were from Jamaica. A characteristic of qualitative samples  is that sample sizes are relatively small to allow in-depth exploration of  the focal phenomenon ( Ritchie, Lewis, Elam, Tennant, & Rahim, 2014 ).  In-depth interviews are a meaningful tool for gathering the perspectives of respondents ( Rubin & Rubin, 2012 ). Semi-structured interview questions, which allow both structure and flexibility, were  developed to guide the interviews ( Flick, 2015 ;  Yeo et al., 2014 ).  Structured interview questions included the following: “What is your  assessment of how the event was leveraged?”; “What were some of the  barriers/challenges to leveraging the event?”; “How did the ICC regulations impact the leveraging of the event?” and “Do you believe  Barbados/Jamaica benefitted from the event?” While preconceived  questions allow the researcher to guide the interview and focus on the  overall research question, a semi-structured interview technique allows  the researcher to probe respondents, when necessary, for a deeper understanding of responses that may allude to emergent themes. For example, as interviews progressed, it became apparent that the rigidity of  the ICC's formalised event rights was responded to differently by each  host nation; the nature of each host's respective response significantly  impacted their capacity for local cultural inclusion in, and business  opportunities from, the event. Therefore, as well as the preceding  questions, probing questions such as, “You mentioned that the regulations made it difficult to ‘showcase local culture,’ would you mind  elaborating on that?” Or, “What exactly did you mean when you used  the term ‘push back’ in reference to the ICC's stipulations on using international suppliers?”  The interviews ranged from 45 to 120 min in duration, were recorded digitally, and were transcribed verbatim. To preserve participants’ anonymity, a five-character alpha-numeric identifier by country  was used. For example, the fourth participant interviewed in Barbados  is identified as 04BRB, and the second participant interviewed in  Jamaica is identified as 02JAM (see  Table 1 ).  Each author individually read the transcripts multiple times to become familiar with the data. During that period of independent work,  the authors developed the initial open codes ( Corbin & Strauss, 2008 ;  Creswell, 2013 ). The authors then convened to discuss their individual  results and deliberated over several rounds until they reached agreement on themes and theme labels. When differences arose, the authors  referred to the raw data to arrive at a resolution. The authors then used  the open codes and knowledge of the event leverage and formalisation  literature to cluster the data into various themes. These steps ensured  the data analysis could withstand scrutiny, serving to enhance the  trustworthiness of the study ( Lincoln & Guba, 1986 ). A grounded theory  model emerged from the analysis (see  Fig. 1 ), showing how the formalised regulations of the event rights owner influences host destinations’ ability to leverage events. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  To deepen understanding of gaming development by framing and  legitimacy, a series of semi-structured in-depth interviews was conducted with residents from several metropolitan cities in China. First,  we adopted a purposive sampling approach ( Patton, 2002 ) to ensure  the informants were selected among the target population from different social groups including those from different parts of Mainland  China. Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen are the four largest  cities in China and located at the eastern and southern part of China,  therefore, we choose respondents from these four cities. To improve the  representation of China, we also selected residents from Qingdao,  Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming and Xi'an, in regions in the northern, central and western parts of the country. Moreover, the respondents had  participated in gaming to various degrees; and they had visited at least  a gaming destination (e.g., Macau) before. It is desirable to choose  experienced participants who had exposure to the research context (i.e.,  gaming), as inexperienced ones would not able to contribute to the  subject matter ( Siggelkow, 2007 ). Experienced participants may provide both subjective and objective meanings and definitions about their  attitude towards gaming, including situated meanings and systematic  divergences in meanings. This approach allows us to understand reality  construction in reference to the relationship of framing and gaming  legitimacy ( Gephart & Robert, 2004 ). Their understandings, perceptions or behaviors were used to determine if a meaning of legitimacy  could emerge. Thus this sample matched the fact that current literature  has explained different framing processes from various types of samples. Second, we followed a theoretical sampling strategy ( Strauss &  Corbin, 1998 ) to clarify and examine the emerging theoretical model.  We chose Chinese to study their gaming experience towards their perception of and behavior concerning legitimacy because extant theorizing of framing and gaming legitimacy focuses predominantly on  Western contexts ( Humphreys & Latour, 2013 ). Through personal  contacts, we approached interviewees to collect the in-depth information which informants were reluctant to share with the unfamiliar interviewer, a known factor to consider in the Chinese culture. A total of  37 interviews were conducted; and some of the informants were interviewed more than twice in order to provide follow-up information  and quality feedback. The interviews typically lasted from 1 to 1.5 h.  The data collection process took approximately three weeks and concluded when no new information could be obtained. The interviewees'  profiles are presented in  Table 1 . Approximately equal numbers of  males and females from different age groups were selected. Some respondents were from the lower-income group, such as factory workers  and salesmen, whereas other participants had middle-class occupations,  such as a doctor, an engineer, and a small-business owner.  In order to explore informants' naturalistic interpretations of the  “frame” in their own expression, we did not provide any definition  about the framing process of gaming legitimacy development. Initial  questions were asked: “How do you like gambling?” and “Who do you  gamble with?” Once we grasped informants’ general understandings of  framing related to gaming, we proceeded with more in-depth questions  germane to their views on gaming development, as described below.  Thematic questions were asked to develop insights into how the gaming  industry is viewed by residents, including its positive and negative  impacts. The primary questions that framed the interviews included,  “What do you think about the gaming industry in China?” “Why do you  support/not support the gaming industry?” “If China further develops  the gaming industry, what is your attitude?”  Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed directly into  English within one week. The interview transcripts were analyzed to  identify recurring patterns. The analytical process followed the procedures of  Marshall and Rossman (2006) . Aside from interviews, historic  narratives about the Chinese residents’ attitude towards the gaming  industry were consulted; press articles and academic journals relating  to both Chinese and other societies were also collected. These materials  were then used to triangulate with the collected interviews.  Table 2  summarizes the usage of various data sources. We used open coding to  identify important concepts; similar codes were then grouped into firstorder categories, which were further grouped into second-order themes.  First, the first two authors interpreted and coded different gaming  attitudes, behaviors and activities with reference to the related legitimacy patterns separately. Then, the two authors compared and contrasted all the initial codes together through several rounds of discussion. Finally, the revised codes were further crosschecked by the third  author to ensure adequate inter-coder reliability ( Guest, Bunce, &  Johnson, 2006 ). Early findings were presented to scholars and Chinese  residents to increase understandability, transferability and transformability of the study. Theoretical integration among three research areas  – legitimacy, framing, and gambling – was done to capture the complexity of the social phenomenon of interest. Throughout the analysis,  we considered the codes in accordance with the literature throughout  the coding process. In order to capture the best themes, we tried to  minimize the differences within the themes but maximize the differences between them. All of the data were crosschecked and analyzed  using the triangulation approach until saturation was reached by all the  researchers. After numerous rounds of a back-and-forth iteration process, first-order categories and second-order themes were identified as  followed. \",\n",
              " \"2. Method  2.1. Site and sample selection  The rigour of qualitative research, involving small samples, can be  enhanced through the representativeness of respondents interviewed,  by adopting a systematic approach to sample design. Selection of a  suitable host destination was informed by four criteria to promote  sample representativeness and the practical significance of findings.  The host destination had to (1) be a major world class destination for  international travellers, (2) include substantial numbers of long-stay  travellers, (3) provide substantive intercultural differences between  host and tourist and (4) provide achievable means of data collection.  Accordingly, Phuket, Thailand was selected as a data collection site  owing to its popularity among international travellers. Indeed, senior  international travellers from diverse cultures make up approximately  35% of the tourists visiting Thailand annually ( Department of Tourism,  2016 ). Phuket is among the top three tourist destinations of Thailand  and is the country's most visited beach destination ( Tourism Authority  of Thailand, 2013 ). Phuket is a preferred destination for long-haul  travellers from Scandinavia, the UK, and Europe, especially for longstay winter holidays, as well as Australians. International tourist arrivals to Phuket have been increasing and reached approximately 13  million in 2016 ( Department of Tourism, 2017 ).  The sample comprised seniors aged 50 and older, vacationing in  Phuket for more than 10 days. The rationale for using 10 days as a  lower parameter for the long-stay period is based on actual tourist  behaviour. The average duration of stay for international tourists is 10  days ( Department of Tourism, 2016 ). The reason the upper parameter  of stay is set at three months is to align with the procedures for Thai  tourist visa exemption. International tourists can stay in Thailand for up  to 90 days (Thai embassy, 2015). Those who stay in Thailand for over  90 days are no longer considered to be tourists. Understandings of onsite tourist behaviour were elicited through face-to-face interviews.  Potential informants were recruited through convenience sampling by  traffic intercept at popular beaches in Phuket and the town area of  Phuket. All informants were recruited during the day time on varying  days of the week, over an extended period of 3 months. Hence, the  scope of data collection allowed for the capture of core visitors to a  beach destination and minimised sampling bias. As the traveller profile  in Phuket more often involved tourists travelling in pairs it was decided  to conduct both individual interviews and dyadic interviews, as appropriate. The set of interviews consisted of 22 interviews of individuals  and 11 interviews of couples.  2.2. Dyadic interviews  While dyadic interviewing is rare in tourism research, the technique  has a number of strengths that suggest it is highly suitable for exploring  tourist behaviour. Its main strength lies in the fact that much tourist  behaviour reflects shared experiences as a couple or group. Travel with  a friend or partner involves multiple joint activities at the host destination, in contrast to home behaviour where shopping, cafes, walking,  fitness, markets, entertainment or hobbies are often individualised.  Dyadic interviewing is an interdependent methodology that accommodates the key assumption of syncratic consumption underlying  joint travel. Dyadic interviewing or joint interviewing involves two  informants and an interviewer interacting concurrently. Hence, the  interview shifts from a one-to-one interaction to a three way interaction  with a consequent increase in data flow. In addition, to interactions  directly between a single informant and interviewer, the interview  comprises interactions between both informants which can be observed  and listened to. Thus, dyadic interviews provide a richer source of information than individual interviews ( Bjornholt & Farstad, 2014 ) and  better match the context of joint travel behaviour.  Individual interviews are the norm in travel research. While such  techniques are appropriate for solo travel behaviour and decision  making, single interviews of informants involved in joint travel have an  inherent weakness. The interview of a single person one-to-one assumes  that thoughts feelings and behaviours derive from the self as autonomous human action ( Bjornholt & Farstad, 2014 ). Yet,  Mead (1934)  argues that the self is essentially relational in nature. Interview data are  not truly regarded as the exact recall and articulation of real experiences by an informant but constructions of experiences delivered in the  context of an interview with a stranger. The decision making and  consequent action by joint travellers are often syncratic and reflect  interdependent human efforts which  Bandura (2000)  argues requires an  understanding of collective agency.  Several advantages are evident for the use of dyadic interviews in  the joint travel context. Interviews provide a ‘cueing’ action where the  information provided by one informant cues the other to remember or  to take in a different direction ( Morgan & Krueger, 1993 ). Interaction  between the dyad provides observational data about the relationship. A  typical interview is an asymmetrical dialogue where interviewer and  interviewee hold different roles, knowledge, and power. In a dyadic  interview there is a less asymmetrical relationship. Informants are already familiar and comfortable with each other and co-construction of  the narrative is easier to manage ( Morgan, 2016 ). Rapport in this threeway context is easier to develop ( Wilson, Onwuegbuzie, & Manning,  2016 ). Finally, there is a high degree of convenience in recruiting  participants who are travelling in pairs.  2.3. Data collection procedures, interpretation and triangulation  Interviews were semi-structured. Initial questions related to basic  information about their trip (e.g., frequency of visit, length of stay,  where staying, how have you spent your time; how do you get travel  information; where do you eat). A second set of questions followed up  to probe further about trip activities (e.g., what do you like doing the  most/least; what would you like to do if staying longer; how do you find  Thai people). These probing questions focused on understanding how  respondents felt about their activities and why. The final part of the  interview expanded into areas uncovered through probing questions  (e.g., tell me more about …). Each interview took about 30–45 min on  average. This period of time allowed for sufficient probing of informants to elicit rich information. After each interview, the recorded  interview was transcribed, with data from some initial interviews being  examined before conducting further interviews. Brief summaries were  also prepared on a progressive basis, allowing the researcher to reflect  on initial insights to guide the later stages of data collection.  Overall, a progressive thematic analysis was utilised to seek out  meanings from the interview transcripts ( Spiggle, 1994 ) and the actual  coding of data was undertaken in three phases, following  Strauss  (1987) . In the first phase, preliminary coding should identify recurring  words and ideas ( Jennings, 2010 ). A second and closely related phase  identified relationships between the codes developed initially. The third  phase examined the codes in a more holistic, integrative approach. A  codebook was created to group the initial open and axial codes and data  were then further coded in phase three through QSR NVivo software.  The three phases of the coding process are illustrated in  Fig. 1 .  Interpretation of data was informed from a social-constructivist  perspective. Social constructivism allows the researcher to deconstruct  meaning from multiple actors elaborating upon shared experiences  ( Jennings, 2010 ) and has been widely utilised in research involving  group travel behaviour (e.g.,  Wang, Weaver, & Kwek, 2016 ;  Weaver,  Kwek, & Wang, 2017 ). While this perspective allows for the generation  of rich insights, data collection from a single source and method can  result in biased findings. Triangulation of collected data enhances data  trustworthiness and can be achieved through differing data sources,  methods, researchers and theories ( Decrop, 1999 ). In social science,  researchers have adopted the dyadic interview as a form of triangulation ( Caldwell, 2014 ). Indeed,  Bjornholt and Farstad (2014)  argue that  where a couple share a form of personal relationship then the dyadic  interview should be viewed as a separate form of qualitative research  interview. In addition, a number of procedural steps were undertaken  to enhance trustworthiness in the data. First, field notes contained more  information than the recorded conversations. While data saturation  seemed to have been reached by the nineteenth interview, further interviews were conducted to check for contrary ideas. Four main themes  reflecting states of intercultural integration emerged at this point and  were cross-checked by two researchers, who subsequently refined and  cross-checked the dimensions for each theme through a process of interpretive iteration between the researchers. A further analyst audit was  undertaken for triangulation purposes ( Patton, 1999 ) by a third  researcher to check for consistency and/or contrary interpretation. \",\n",
              " \"exploitation of children ( Accor Hotels, 2016 ). Hilton's  “ Travel with a  purpose ”  includes initiatives focused on sustainable travel and tourism,  providing opportunities for young people and funding projects that  support local communities ( Hilton, 2019 ). Studies have identified numerous positive impacts of CSR strategies for tourism accommodation  providers, including increasing consumer trust, customer satisfaction,  brand preference, identification with the company, consumer loyalty,  corporate and brand reputation and purchase intention ( Gao & Mattila,  2014 ;  Liu, Wong, Shi, Chu, & Brock, 2014 ;  Martínez & Bosque, 2013 ;  Su, Swanson, & Chen, 2015 ). CSR initiatives have also been linked to  price, with tourists who have stronger pro-environmental attitudes  stating they would pay more for hotels that implement green initiatives  ( Kang, Stein, Heo, & Lee, 2012 ). Yet, we have only limited understanding about the  relative  importance of CSR compared to other product attributes. For example: to what extent would consumers tolerate  reductions in accommodation luxury to support socially responsible  accommodation providers?  A recent review of CSR research in the hotel context revealed a  paucity of empirical studies on this topic, with the authors concluding  that  “ consumer reactions to CSR and the link between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) are still important gaps regarding  research on CSR in the hotel industry ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p.  15). They note wide variation in the quality and clarity of company  communications of their CSR activities, stating that  “ extra effort trying  to find out the best way to communicate CSR to the different stakeholders would be welcomed ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p. 35).  Specifically, on the impact of CSR strategies on consumers, the review  revealed most studies to be quantitative and use structural equation  modelling to examine relationships between variables, and also noted  the  “ absolute predominance of studies on Asian markets and, particularly, in China ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p. 28). They also note the  lack  of  managerially  useful  segmentation  studies  ( Dolnicar  &  Lazarevski, 2009 ) and a general presupposition by researchers that all  consumers will react to CSR messages in the same way. They suggest  that  “ segmentation studies within these groups could shed new light on  the underlying mechanisms linking CSR to consumers  …”  ( SerraCantallops et al., 2018 , p. 33).  With a view to filling these identified gaps in knowledge, the present study poses the following research questions in the context of  holiday accommodation choice: (1) What is the relative impact of environmental and community CSR initiatives on holiday accommodation  choice? (2) If there is impact, does the impact generalize to the entire  population or is it limited to specific segments only? (3) What is the  most effective way of framing CSR-initiatives in communications? We  examine the relative importance of three factors assumed to increase  message effectiveness: consumer involvement, message-framing and  donation proximity ( Grau & Folse, 2007 ). Methodologically, the present  study extends existing knowledge (1) analytically, by using a stated  choice modelling technique to examine the  relative  importance of CSR  in consumer decision making; and (2) geographically, by conducting  the study in Australia.  3. Method  We conduct an empirical study in the context of online holiday  accommodation purchases, because (1) it is unclear whether findings  relating to fast-moving consumer goods can be generalized to tourism,  and (2) tourism accommodation providers place heavy emphasis on  CSR initiatives: 80% of hotels implement community-related CSR activities and 60% have CSR strategies related to employment and the  marketplace ( Accor Hotels, 2016 ;  Hilton, 2019 ;  Holcomb, Upchurch, &  Okumus, 2007 ).  3.1. Stated choice experiment  We used a  stated choice experiment  ( Hensher, Rose, & Greene, 2015 )  to describe and predict the probability that holiday accommodation  will be booked online as a function of its characteristics, including CSR  attributes. Respondents are asked to trade-off product features, similarly to real life choice situations. Choice experiments also allow for  inclusion of attributes of interest, the impact of which can be simulated.  We identified 11 characteristics salient to holiday accommodation  choice by reviewing popular online hotel booking sites: price, internet,  kitchen, check in, washer and dryer, parking, air conditioning, indoor fireplace and a pool. To check the appropriateness of these characteristics we compared them with another recent study that examined the  price impact of the full range of accommodation characteristics which  currently appear on Airbnb accommodation websites ( Hrobath, Leisch,  & Dolnicar, 2017 ). We then included two types of CSR initiatives  commonly employed by accommodation providers ( Holcomb et al.,  2007 ): community donations and environmental sustainability. We  defined each attribute at a number of levels ( Table 1 ). Price, community  donations and contribution to environmental sustainability each had five levels. To test the effect of cause proximity and message framing on  CSR messages, we used two levels of cause proximity (local and international) and two levels of message framing (positive and negative). We  added a base level (does not donate/contribute) to each CSR attribute.  The other attributes were each defined at two levels typical for hotel  booking sites. These attributes are either present or not (e.g. pool and fireplace).  Given that the choice experiment included three attributes with five  levels each and eight attributes with two levels each, 32,000 possible  combinations of attributes existed. Because such a large number of  combinations cannot be tested empirically, we constructed an orthogonal fraction of this design with 100 hypothetical holiday accommodation options ( Hensher et al., 2015 ). These 100 holiday accommodation options were randomly divided over choice sets. Each choice  set contained three alternative holiday homes to choose from. Study  participants could also choose not to book any of the available options.  Table 2  shows a sample choice set.  Each respondent evaluated 12 choice sets (saw 36 choice alternatives). This means that responses from three respondents were  needed to evaluate one complete design. For each choice set, respondents saw the following instructions:  “ Imagine you are planning a  one-week summer holiday with six friends. They have given you the job of  booking a holiday home. You will now see a number of holiday homes which  are available at the desired destination. All of them have enough beds, bed  linen and towels, a TV, a laptop-friendly workspace, a hair dryer, hangers,  and iron, a safety card, first aid kit, fire extinguisher and smoke detector.  Shops and a gym are only 10 min ’  walk away. All of the holiday homes you  will see also have a garden, are child-friendly and wheelchair accessible, but  they do not provide breakfast. ”  Evaluating 12 choice sets is not a particularly onerous task; even  higher numbers of choice sets do not affect response rates or parameter  estimates systematically ( Bech, Kjaer, & Lauridsen, 2011 ). Also, the  choice sets were embedded in an online questionnaire system developed by one of the author's universities specifically to support random  distribution of choice alternatives across choice sets. This approach  avoids dominant choice sets (where the most desirable choice is obvious) and prevents order effects.  Involvement in community issues  was measured with an altruism scale  ( Rushton, Chrisjoh, & Fekken, 1981 ). The full scale has 20 items, but  three were not relevant to this study (e.g. one item refers to pulling a  neighbour's car out of the snow; most parts of Australia never see  snow). Examples of items include  “ I have given money to a charity ” ,  “ I  have given directions to a stranger ”  and  “ I have helped an acquaintance  to move households ” .  Involvement with environmental issues  was measured using the revised  New Environmental Paradigm scale ( Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, &  Jones, 2000 ). Participants saw 15 statements about the environment  and indicated their agreement from strongly disagree ( − 2) to strongly  agree (+2). Examples of items include  “ humans are severely abusing  the environment ” ,  “ plants and animals have just as much right to exist  as humans ”  and  “ the balance of nature is very delicate and easily  upset ” .  Important aspects of holiday travel  was measured using a list of 25  features of holidays. Participants expressed importance on a binary  (yes/no) answer scale. Aspects included:  “ I want to rest and relax ” ,  “ I  want many entertainment facilities ” ,  “ I am interested in the lifestyle ” ,  “ it is important to me that I can feel safe ”  and  “ cultural offerings and  sights are a crucial factor ” .  Personal characteristics  of participants included age, sex, marital  status, employment status, whether they have children and perceptions  of their household income level compared to most Australians.  3.2. Fieldwork administration and sample characteristics  The stated choice experiment and the survey questions took about  30 min to complete using an online self-completion questionnaire. We  collected data in September 2017 with approval of the university's  human research ethics committee. We recruited participants using an  online research panel company. Study participants representative of the  Australian adult population received an email invitation; they must  have booked holiday accommodation online in the past three years to  be eligible to complete the survey.  Table 3  shows key sample characteristics of the 1052 respondents.  3.3. Data analysis  We used a latent class modelling approach to group respondents  into segments (latent classes) that differ in holiday accommodation  attribute preferences ( Boxall & Adamowicz, 2002 ;  Greene & Hensher,  2002 ;  Swait, 1994 ). The model estimation leads to separate parameters  for each segment. We assume that the utility tourists derive from  booking a holiday home is based on the attributes of holiday homes  (including the CSR attributes). For the multinomial logit model (MNL),  the utility for tourist  i  for a holiday home alternative  j  when making a  choice at time  t  is:  where  x  represents attributes with their relative weights (parameters  β ′ ), which are estimated by the model. An error term ( ɛ ) represents  unobserved heterogeneity in the utility. The MNL model assumes the  same parameters across all tourists. It is reasonable to assume the existence of homogeneous tourist segments, which have different holiday  home booking preferences. If a tourist is a member of segment  s  ( s  = 1,  … .,  S ), the utility for tourist  i  belonging to segment  s  for holiday home  alternative  j  for choice  t  is:  where  β ′  is the segment parameter vector for segment  s . Choice probabilities result from the utility function of the latent class multinomial  model (LCM). The probability that tourist  i  chooses to book holiday  home  j  when making choice  t  is:  The probability of being a member of segment  s  for each tourist  i  is:  Z  represents additional characteristics which do not vary across  choice situations. If there are no  Z , the segment-specific probabilities  are fixed constants adding up to one. Each tourist is assumed to belong  to the segment with maximum probability.  We estimate latent class parameters using maximum likelihood estimation ( Greene, 2001 ), using the likelihood ratio test statistic ( G2  =  2[LL(0)-LL(B)] ) to assess whether or not the estimated model  LL(B) is  significantly better than the null model  LL(0) . We estimate model fit  using McFadden's Rho square  ( ρ = 1-LLB /LL0),  and choose how many  segments to extract with the help of the Akaike Information Criterion  (AIC =  − 2(LLB-P), e.g.  Gupta & Chintagunta, 1994 , pp. 128 – 136;  Kamakura & Russell, 1989 ). \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  Our study follows an exploratory sequential mixed methods approach, whereby qualitative and quantitative research techniques,  methods and concepts were combined in an attempt to use their complementary strengths and reduce the weaknesses of each method on its  own ( Burke Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004 ;  Creswell, Shope, Plano  Clark, & Green, 2006 ;  Onwuegbuzie & Burke Johnson, 2006 ). Qualitative research in the form of focus group interviews was carried out to  explore broad concepts and to develop propositions, which were later  tested quantitatively through a survey (n = 303). The relative importance of the qualitative and quantitative components of the study  are defined as qual > QUANT ( Burke Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004 ;  Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2006 ;  Yin, 2006 ).  3.1. Focus groups  Phase one of our research consisted of four focus groups with 3–4  participants each, representing a total of 14 family units. Focus groups  were selected as the most appropriate method as they can capture insights on behaviour and provide valuable qualitative data with regard  to SWB and definitions of quality ( Krueger & Casey, 2014 , pp. 11–13).  The main aim of our focus groups was to use these insights and  definitions as the foundation to develop survey research into family  festivals and events. A single category focus group design ( Krueger &  Casey, 2014 , p. 27) was applied in this study. Local community groups  were contacted (such as toddler groups, cultural groups, social media  sites), and local events in Hertfordshire, UK, were visited to recruit  participants. Following this a snowball sampling technique was used to  identify further potential participants. These methods of recruitment  were used to enable a higher degree of self-disclosure ( Krueger & Casey,  2014 , p. 5) during the focus groups through commonalities such as:  being a resident in the same location in Hertfordshire, belonging to a  group, attending similar types of events as a family, or having children  of a similar age.  It is important to note that gender specific analysis was not the focus  of this study, once families were approached to join a focus group we  allowed the parents to make the decision as to who should represent the  family unit. For the majority of focus groups, it was the mothers who  decided to come and represent the views of the family. The higher representation by mothers follows the UK Office for National Statistics  (ONS) data with higher childcare hours by mothers per week in the UK  (women 4.7 h/men 1.9 h) ( ONS, 2014 ) and a higher percentage of  mothers as non-working stay at home parents (35% of Mothers/7% of  Fathers) ( ONS, 2014 ).  Table 4  summarises the characteristics of our focus group sample.  Children within our focus group sample were aged between 2 and 10,  including one family with two small children (3 and 6) as well as a 15year old child from a previous marriage. The focus groups were held in  local church halls or community centres and each lasted for approximately 60 min.  The focus groups used a traditional questioning route with parents  which was backed by theoretically underpinned studies into family  QOL, leisure and events. The full list of questions is identified within  Table 5 .  Analysis of our focus group data was systematic, firstly the audio  recordings were transcribed verbatim and later coded and analysed  using NVivo software (version 11.4.3). Following transcription, 17  codes were identified in the data, and later arranged into 8 categories  (see  Table 6  below). Both codes and categories were in a final step  realigned with existing literature in order to develop key themes  ( Bazeley, 2007 ).  The example below (FG4/N) illustrates a set of initial codes (underlined) which was identified in the raw data. For each code the frequency (how often was it mentioned), extensiveness (by how many  people) and intensity (how much passion or force was behind the  comments) were identified ( Krueger & Casey, 2014 ). Specific attention  was also given to participants' perception of importance of each concept  (e.g. QOL was consistently identified as very important to families) and  whether the participants were consistent in their view or if it changed  throughout the interview ( Krueger & Casey, 2014 ). The codes were then  arranged into categories, such as ‘Memorable Event Experience’ (e.g.,  do something a little bit different; extra entertainment; memory of  going on the steam train with nana and granddad) or ‘familial bonding’  (e.g., extended family; going on the steam train with nana and  granddad; I've connected with him). The codes and categories were in a  final step realigned with the QOL theoretical frameworks discussed  above, to develop key themes. In the example below this would be:  ‘familial bonding’ through ‘leisure’ and ‘Memorable Event Experiences’  contributes to participants' ‘emotional well-being’ (a nicer feeling for  me; he's enjoyed it; quality-of-life), and enhances interpersonal relations and physical well-being, which are key indicators of family QOL.  FG4/N: It's just taking them out of that home environment to do  something a little bit different which will kind of give them that  little bit of extra entertainment for half an hour, which makes … I  mean my husband didn't come that day because he was playing golf,  but the rest of the extended family was with us. So actually, he's now  got that memory of going on the steam train with nana and  granddad and actually it's a nicer feeling for me in terms of, like you  say, the quality of life because I feel like I've done something with  him, I've connected with him and he's enjoyed it.  Based on the systematic analysis of focus group data, the identified  categories and key themes highlighted potential connections between  the variables ‘positive memories’, ‘family bonding’, ‘family connection’  and ‘family QOL’. The following propositions were therefore developed  to be tested quantitatively through survey sampling:  P1: Positive memories created at a festival/event help develop a  stronger emotional bond between members of the family  P2: Positive memories created at a festival/event help develop a  stronger connection between members of the family  P3: The higher the frequency of festival/event memory discourse  amongst family members the stronger the emotional bonds within  the family become in the long-run  P4: The higher the frequency of festival/event memory discourse  amongst family members the stronger the connection between  members of the family becomes in the long-run  3.2. Survey sampling and weighting strategy  Our survey design was informed by the analysis of our qualitative  focus groups (Phase one) and integrated the four propositions (P1–P4)  highlighted in the previous section. In an attempt to explore subjective  as well as objective measures of QOL as defined in the literature review,  some questions were aimed at confirming specific statements from  focus groups (e.g. Our family have formed a stronger emotional bond as  a result of attending this event/festival – agree/disagree/undecided),  other questions were partly discussed in focus groups but also based on  previous research and theoretical context (e.g. Please circle the words  below which you feel contribute to your family's Quality of Life – Time,  Space, Money/wealth, Health, Rest, Happy children, Being in a happy  loving family, Feeling safe, Other - please specify). The questionnaire  consisted of a total of 25 questions, including demographic questions  such as ethnic background, postcode, number and age of children.  When handing these out at live events, participants were strongly encouraged to discuss each question as a family in order to capture their  aggregated perspective (as advocated by  Poston et al., 2003 ), rather  than merely one family member filling in the questionnaire on behalf of  the entire family unit.  Over a period of four months in 2016 (June–September) a range of  events across Hertfordshire with a specific family focus, program or  theme were targeted. In order to get a good representation of different  types of events (sport, music, carnival, school fair, etc.), the organisers  of 15 suitable events were approached. Ten of them gave permission to  collect data on site. Once on site, a purposive sampling technique to  collect questionnaires was employed, which meant using the research  team's own judgement in identifying family units with young children  (between 2 and 10 years) attending the event together, for example as  they were arriving/leaving together, queueing, sitting together on a  picnic rug, parents watching their children on the bouncy castle/ride,  or  similar.  Every  fifth  family  that  fit  these  criteria  was  then  systematically approached in order to include a diverse range of ages,  backgrounds and cultures. A total of 319 questionnaires were collected  using this method. However, as we were seeking to extrapolate the  results of our analyses to a wider population, it is important that the  sample is representative of this population or to apply weights to make  it more representative. In line with the above identified definition of  family as “two or more persons who share resources, share responsibility for decisions, share values and goals, and have a commitment to  one another over time, (…) regardless of blood, legal ties, adoption, or  marriage” ( DeFrain & Asay, 2007 , p. 284), the final sample therefore  encompassed all respondents that fitted these criteria. This included for  example, grandparents attending the event with their grandchildren, or  families with children from a previous marriage. In terms of the children's’ age range, any family with at least one child aged between 2 and  10 years was included.  Based on these criteria and after further excluding questionnaires  that were not fully completed, the final sample was 303 questionnaires.  The number of children per family unit within this sample ranged from  1 to 6. Respondents’ ethnic backgrounds were representative of the  wider demographic statistics of the region (see ONS 2011 Census and  2016 Estimates), with 83.1% British, 7.4% European, 1.9% Australian/  New Zealand, 1.3% Indian, 0.9% American, 0.9% South African, 0.9%  Arabic, and 2.1% Mixed Race. The remaining 1.5% identified themselves as Peruvian, Caribbean, Philippine and Sri Lankan. In terms of  their current place of residence, the majority (94.2%) were local to the  area where the chosen events took place (their postcode was within a  10-mile radius of St Albans, Harpenden, Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City  or Pirton).  The number of respondents from each of the ten events/festivals are  shown in  Table 7 . The range of different types of events/festivals is  wide but the number of respondents that were obtained at each event/  festival was dependent upon many factors (e.g. time, personnel, and  weather conditions). It is thus possible that families who attend some  types of event (e.g. sport, represented here by the St Albans Half  Marathon) may be over or under-represented when compared with the  population of families attending different types of events/festivals. In  order to consider a weighting system, specific figures for the numbers of  families attending different types of events/festivals in the population  of interest were needed. Such information, however, is not readily  available. A question was therefore included in the survey which asked  whether or not families regularly attended a range of different types of  event/festival (festivals, sports, music, food/drink, cultural, live, school  fairs, or carnivals – tick all that apply). Classifying the events/festivals  in the data in a similar manner (type Garden will be discussed below),  Table 8  shows the number of people from each type of event who said  they regularly attended different types of events/festivals.  It is clearly not surprising to find that 91.3% of respondents observed at a school fair said they regularly attend school fairs. Thus,  these respondents cannot give useful information about the percentage  of families in our population of interest who attend school fairs.  However, they are still members of the population of interest and can  therefore provide estimates of the proportion of families who attend  other types of event (i.e. 23 families observed at school fairs suggest  that 47.8% of families in this population of interest attend festivals,  30.4% attend sporting events, 30.4% attend music events, 73.9% attend  food/drink events, 60.9% attend cultural events, 52.2% attend live  events and 73.9% attend carnivals).  Similarly, families observed at other types of event (festival, carnival, music, garden and sports) also give estimates of the proportion of  families in the population of interest who attend different types of  events/festivals. Thus, concentrating on festival attendance, those observed at school fairs suggest 47.8% of families attend festivals, those  observed at carnivals suggest 50.5%, those observed at music events  suggest 59.7%, those observed at garden events suggest 58.3% and  those at sporting events suggest 35.0%. This is a relatively wide range  of estimates but is to be expected because attendance at different types  of event is unlikely to be independent (it is not surprising to find that  those who go to music events are most likely to regularly attend festivals and those who go to sporting events are least likely to attend festivals). To overcome this lack of independence, it is sensible to discard  the highest and lowest estimates above and use the median figure (here  50.5%) as the best estimate of the proportion of families who regularly  attend festivals.  Applying this logic to all the types of event/festival gives the estimates in  Table 9 . From this information it can be seen that those attending school fairs need to be well-represented in the sample of respondents and certainly better represented than those at sporting or  music events, for instance. More precisely, for each respondent attending a sporting event, 2.133 (80%/37.5%) respondents attending a  school fair are needed and for each respondent attending a music event,  2.206 (80%/36.3%) respondents attending a school fair are needed.  Retaining the total sample size of 303 and applying this logic, the  weights and effective sample sizes shown in  Table 10  can be obtained.\",\n",
              " \"2. Methods  A literature review together with open interviews with the community allowed establishing a cognizance of the six study sites ( Fig. 1 ).  A semi-structured survey allowed to identify changes in restaurant  owners' perspectives regarding tourism growth, and consumer demand  for seafood ( Bernard, 2006 ;  Appendices B, C ). Tourists were surveyed  with a structured questionnaire focused on the interviewee's knowledge  of the environment and seafood consumption preferences ( Appendices  D, E ). The survey method utilized was convenience sampling for both  types of surveys. The potential bias of convenience sampling was  counteracted by surveying as many restaurants (from the ABTs different  tourist hubs;  Fig. 1 ) and individuals that identified themselves as  tourists ( Given, 2008 ;  Etikan, Musa, & Alkassim, 2016 ). All qualitative  data from the restaurant owner surveys were compiled to create a  narrative of the restaurants in relationship to local fish stocks and  questions 9 and 10, the numbers of responses for each question were  summed and inputted into bar charts ( Fig. 3 A). The percentage of each  type of local and imported seafood sold in restaurants was calculated  and a qualitative representation was created ( Fig. 5 ). The number of  responses for each question of the tourist survey was summed and  displayed into bar charts; the comments of question 5 were compiled  into a pie chart ( Figs. 6 and 7 ). \",\n",
              " \"2. Methodology  Based on different types of literature reviews summarized by  Briner  and Denyer (2012) , this paper combines meta-analytic review method,  expert thematic or argument based review method and systematic review method together to analyse and syntheses climate, microclimate  and microclimate tourism concept, to explores microclimate tourism  mechanisms, and to summarizes microclimate tourism security and  safety as well as relative measures and suggestions. China Knowledge  Resource Integrated Database (CNKID) ( www.cnki.net ) is the most  powerful China academic engine to search both Chinese and foreign  academic publications, which integrates journal papers, conference  proceedings, degree theses, newspaper articles and books into database  searching process and protocol. As for foreign academic publications  searching services provided by CNKID, it includes journal literature  titles data from more than 50 famous international publishers such as  Springer, Taylor & Francis, John Wiley & Sons, Wolters Kluwer, ProQuest, PubMed, and J-STAGE etc.., and it almost covers 90% journals  within SCI, SSCI and EI Index Lists, which all together accounts for  more than 50 million articles that could be searched from keywords,  titles, authors, DOI, or their combinations. The data of foreign academic  publications collected in CNKID starts early from 1840 until now while  the Taylor & Francis journal database starts later from 1904 to now.  Considering all merits mentioned above, the CNKID has been chose for  this paper's literature review database.  CNKID was searched in this study for Chinese and foreign researches  of climate, social climate, microclimate, tourism security and safety,  and climate security and safety through entering Chinese terms of  “ qi  hou  ” , “ she hui fen wei or she hui qi hou  ” ,  “ wei qi hou ” ,  “ lv you an qua ”  and “ qi hou an quan ”  into keywords, title and subject as searching  condition from 01/01/1936 to 10/08/2018 in CNKID ( http://kns.cnki.  net/kns/brief/result.aspx?dbprefix=SCDB ); and the search terms of  “ climate ” ,  “ social  climate ” , “ microclimate ” ,  “ tourism  security  and  safety ”  and  “ climate security and safety ”  was entered into keywords,  title and subject for searching respective foreign researches in CNKID  ( http://kns.cnki.net/kns/brief/result.aspx?dbprefix=WWJD ) from 01/  01/1843 to 10/08/2018. A total of 32,642 climate researches, 242  social climate researches, 922 microclimate researches, 66 climate security and safety researches and 998 tourism security and safety researches were collected. This total data-set was then re-organized on  Excel recording publications trends and disciplines distributions details.  Meanwhile, the keywords co-occurrence networks naturally generated  by means of visualization analysis function of CNKID. It should be  noticed that not all the literature published in 2018 were collected, and  the study only covers the period to August 10th, 2018. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  Traditional data collection methods such as questionnaire surveys  are subject to the potential limitations of inefficient and incomplete.  Advances in mobile technologies have led to the creation of large volumes of user-generated data, such as travel movements ( Li, Law, Vu,  Rong, & Zhao, 2015 ). Thus, to obtain accurate results and implications,  data were retrieved via the mobile phone signal of China Unicom as  smartphone is considered a necessity for tourists. Hence, data retrieval  through mobile phone signal makes data more comprehensive. This  method enabled researchers to track the movements of tourists travelling to Tibetan attractions rated 4A or above from September to November 2018. China's tourist attraction rating categories were established in 1999 and extended in 2004. This rating system aims to  determine the quality of the attractions, such as safety and cleanliness  ( China National Tourism Administration, 2018 ). It is based on the  ‘Categories and Rating Standard of Tourist Attractions’ code advocated  by  Ryan, Gu, and Meng (2009) , which includes five categories ranging  from 1A (lowest) to 5A (highest). In the present study, Tibetan attractions were rated according to this system. On the basis of the administrative regions in Tibet, 19 attractions rated category 4A or above  were retrieved ( Fig. 1 ). Ngari prefecture is located in western Tibet that  witnessed Tibet civilization. Xigaze prefecture, the previous political  and cultural center, is full of prosperous Buddhism culture. Lhasa prefecture is located in the central part of Tibet, and is a spiritual city with  a number of temples and monasteries. Located in the southern Tibet,  Shannan prefecture is the origin of Tibetan culture. Lying in the southeastern part of Tibet, Nyingchi prefecture is surrounded by natural  sceneries such as beautiful lakes and lush growth of forests.  Among the 19 retrieved attractions, two ( Kangrinboqe Peak, Magical  Mountain and Holy Lake ) are located in Ngari prefecture (NgP), two are  located ( Everest Base Camp and Sagya Monastery ) in Xigaze prefecture  (XiP), eight are located ( Jokhang Temple, Norbulinka Monastery, The  Potala Palace, Drepung Monastery, Yak Museum of Tibet, Tibet Museum,  Lake Namtso and Nyangra Flok Customers Resort ) in Lhasa prefecture  (LhP), one is located ( Samye Temple ) in Shannan prefecture (ShP) and  six are located ( Lulang Forest, Mount Namjagbarwa, Basom Lake, Yarlung  Zangbo River, Nanyi Valley and Midui Glacier ) in Nyingchi prefecture  (NyP). \",\n",
              " \"3. Method  3.1. Research design  To identify tourists ’  potential demand from online travel reviews  and improve customer satisfaction, we propose a semantic association  analysis approach for practical guidelines in fields related to opinion  mining, as shown in  Fig. 1 , which summarizes the process used in this  study. In this paper, web crawlers are first used to extract online travel  reviews from three major OTA websites in China. Then, the data are  pre-processed to build a review dataset using natural language processing (NLP), such as Jieba and NLTK, in Python programming language, including data cleaning and tokenization. Finally, statistical  analysis of thematic words, semantic association analysis and visualization are performed on the data.  3.2. Data collection  In previous studies, most articles only retrieved online travel review  data from a single platform ( Banerjee & Chua, 2016 ;  Cheng, Fu, Sun,  Bilgihan, & Okumus, 2019 ;  Fang et al., 2016 ;  Guo et al., 2017 ;  Kim,  Park, Yun, & Yun, 2017 ;  Liu et al., 2018 ;  Schuckert et al., 2015b ;  Ye, Li,  & Wang, 2014 ;  Zhang et al., 2016a ,  b ) or even from only a single  destination ( Lui, Bartosiak, Piccoli, & Sadhya, 2018 ). To obtain the  most representative data in this study, we choose three major OTAs  platforms (Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng) as the data source and extract  online travel reviews using Python programming language. Ctrip  ( http://www.ctrip.com/ ), Tuniu ( http://www.tuniu.com ) and Tongcheng ( http://www.ly.com ) are the top three Chinese OTAs and lead  new business to customer (B2C) tourism e-commerce websites. As of the  end of December 2017, their market shares were 43.6%, 22.7% and  11.1%, respectively. Ctrip, which was founded in 1999, is one of the  largest integrated online travel service companies. By the end of May  2018, it had more than 300 million registered users. Tuniu provides  more than one million tourism products for consumers, covering selfhelp, self-driving, cruise, hotels, visas, tickets for scenic spots, company  tours, etc. Tongcheng is the most professional online service platform  for leisure tourism in China. According to a report from iResearch.cn, in  May 2018, the active monthly users of Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng  were  68.55  million,  8.3  million  and  22.2  million,  respectively  ( iResearch, 2018 ). The platforms of Ctrip ( Lu & Liu, 2016 ;  Qi, Li, Zhu, &  Shi, 2017 ), Tuniu ( Lian & Yu, 2017 ;  Zhang & Zhou, 2018 ) and Tongcheng ( Li & Yi, 2014 ;  Wang & Wang, 2018 ) have been used many times  as samples in prior studies; therefore, the selection of these data platforms for online travel reviews is reasonable.  The data collection took place in June 2018. We collected review  data on the Top ten tourist cities in China released by the  2018 Global  Destination Marketing Summit and World Culture and Tourism Forum  ( ShaanxiDaily, 2018 ), including Shanghai, Beijing, Xi'an, Chengdu,  Hangzhou, Sanya, Hongkong, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing. Web  crawlers ( Xiang et al., 2017 ) designed in the Python programming  language were used to mimic a user's access to the three OTA websites  for all the tourist products of the ten cities, and the user ID, product  name, review text and review time of the search results were downloaded, as shown in  Fig. 2 . To maintain the timeliness of the data, we  only crawled online review information from January 2015 to June  2018.  3.3. Data pre-processing  All reviews collected from the three OTA platforms were pre-processed by four operations: data cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal and the translation of Chinese words to English. Data cleaning  was used to detect and remove inaccurate or useless records from online  textual data, such as misspellings and non-target language ( Guo et al.,  2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ), leaving only valuable tourism-related information. In this study, we first deleted reviews with a textual length  of less than 15 words. The length of the textual portion of the review  positively affects  “ helpfulness ”  perceptions ( Racherla & Friske, 2012 ).  Cai, Xu, and Wu (2014)  also found that information value was poor  when the length of Chinese language-based online reviews was less  than 15 words. Second, because multiple repeated reviews posted by a  single user may lead to statistical bias, we kept only one record in a  user's duplicate record. Finally, we deleted the reviews that were advertisements to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data samples.  Table 1  presents the results after the data cleaning of the reviews  in Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng. We collected approximately 47,000  reviews from Ctrip, 51,000 reviews from Tuniu, and 67,000 reviews  from Tongcheng. Although Tongcheng had the largest number of reviews, Tuniu had the highest number of Chinese words (approx.  4,084,000) and the highest average length of reviews (80.32 words).  The purpose of tokenization is to divide travel review texts into  keywords, phrases or other meaningful elements, such as tourist spots  and travel feelings ( Guo et al., 2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ). For this study,  we applied the existing open source tool LTP (see  http://ir.hit.edu.cn/  ltp/ ) provided by the Research Centre for Social Computing and Information Retrieval of Harbin Institute of Technology ( Che, Li, & Liu,  2010 ) and Python 3.6.4 (see  https://www.python.org ) to implement  tokenization and stop word removal for all effective reviews. The stop  word list, which consisted of 1893 Chinese words, came from Harbin  Institute of Technology and has been widely applied in opinion mining  and analytics.  Because the reviews were posted in Chinese, we adopted the following translation method to ensure the accuracy of the translation.  First, we divided the translators into two groups, with two persons in  each group. The first group was led by the first author of this article,  and the second group was led by an English teacher. All participants  possessed an excellent level of English and were able to use native  English. After dividing the group, we selected the top 2000 words in  thematic word tables for each platform for translation. The translation  work of each group was performed independently and simultaneously,  and no discussion was held until the formal translation was completed.  If uncertain thematic words were found in the translation, the participants marked them as  “ uncertain ”  thematic words and discussed them  in the next step. After completing the first translation, we compared the  translation results of the two groups one by one to avoid translation  bias, especially with regard to the  “ uncertain ”  thematic words.  3.4. Data analysis  3.4.1. Analysis of thematic words  A thematic word is a word with a definite meaning and the characteristics of conciseness and timeliness as well a large amount of information. An analysis of thematic words aims to remove words that are  meaningless and thereby affect the research results of the keywords  extracted from the online review text through data pre-processing. It  also aims to calculate the frequency of keywords in the text ( Yuan &  Wu, 2016 ). The Jieba toolkit was used for the tokenization and stop  word removal of all the review data. A Chinese word segmentation  module was used that developed by Chinese programmers in Python.  This approach was mostly used in the text mining and the Chinese word  segmentation in search engines. Additionally, the NLTK was used to  calculate the frequency of the thematic words. The calculation formula  is as shown in Equation  (1) :  (1)  where  F  is the frequency of a thematic word  i  in each platform,  R  is the  occurrence number of  i  in the review text,  L  is the length of  i , and  L  is  the length of all words in each platform. Therefore, in this study, the  range of  t  is from 1 to 3, representing the three OTAs platforms, respectively.  3.4.2. Semantic association analysis  Semantic association is an essential element of human language  from which people can infer valuable information in communication  ( Kim, Karunanayaka, Privitera, Holland, & Szaflarski, 2011 ). In this  study, we first constructed semantic association bigram co-occurrence  phrases of thematic words using NTLK and Jieba. For example, an  original review appeared as follows:  整 体 不 错 。 住 宿 和 餐饮 挺 好 的 , 行 程 安 排 也 好 。 就 是 导 游 服 务 能 再 提  高 就 更 好 了 。  The translation is as follows:  Overall good. The accommodations and dining are fine, and the  schedule is also good. It would be even better if the tour guide service  could be further improved.  After pre-processing of the review, the text was as follows:  整 体 / 不 错 / 。 / 住 宿 / 餐饮 / 挺 好 /,/ 行 程 / 安 排 / 也 好 / 。 / 就 是 / 导 游 / 服  务 / 能 / 再 / 提 高 / 就 / 更 好 / 了 / 。  The results of the semantic association bigrams co-occurrence of  thematic words are shown in  Table 2 .  Then, we accumulated the frequency of the bigram co-occurrence  phrases to generate co-occurrence phrase lists for the three platforms  for social network analysis. Gephi, a popular open-source software for  graph and network analysis developed by the research institutions of  SciencesPo and Linkfluence in France, which is widely applied in the fields of social network analysis, biology, and genomics ( Bastian,  Heymann, & Jacomy, 2009 ;  Jacomy, Venturini, Heymann, & Bastian,  2014 ), was used in this study for network structure feature analysis and  visualization. \",\n",
              " \"2. Methodology  The study employed both qualitative and quantitative methodologies with data drawn from multiple sources. The quantitative data  provided evidence of the financial impact of the program in terms of  direct expenditure made by the convention centre on NSW produce.  This data represented the majority of the convention centre's NSWbased suppliers. The qualitative data allowed an in-depth analysis of the  strategy and its outcomes in the context of the issues facing regional  NSW. This data were drawn from a range of stakeholders including  convention centre operators, regional destination manager, government  minister, NSW wine association representative, and approximately 15  per cent of the NSW partner suppliers. Interview data were supplemented with additional information on the convention centre, suppliers, and government policy collected from websites and managerial  documents.  Procurement data were retrieved from managerial documents of the  convention centre and analysed to determine the direct expenditure by  the convention centre on NSW produce and wine in the 2017 calendar  year. These data were analysed using Excel and SPSS. A multiplier was  applied to gain an estimation of the economic contribution to the NSW  economy.  Interviews were conducted by the authors with nine NSW producers, either at their workplaces or by phone. The suppliers were chosen  from a list supplied by the convention centre and represent a range of  food and beverage types ( Table 1 ). Nine producers captures 15 per cent  of local farmers who supply the convention centre. Interviews were also  conducted with a state government minister, and a state Wine Industry  Association representative. In addition, interviews with eight executive  staff from the convention centre, and one regional destination manager  were conducted on the premises of the convention centre.  A semi-structured research instrument consisting of 14 open-ended  questions was developed to capture information on the arrangements  producers had in place to supply the convention centre, as well as how  their businesses had altered as a result of supplying produce to the  convention centre. The research instrument was adapted for interviews  with the state politician, wine industry association and the state tourism  and event sector representative body. These interviews lasted between  45 and 90 min. In the majority of instances, post interviews involved  tours of suppliers’ work sites and farms. The research instrument used  in interviews with the convention centre executives consisted of 12  open-ended  questions  designed  to  capture  knowledge  and  understanding of the aims of the organisation and practices required to  implement a SFSC strategy. These interviews also lasted between 45  and 90 min.  All interviews occurred in the period January–May 2018. Most interviews were conducted in person with three conducted over the telephone.  Table 1  provides an overview of interview participants. Interviews  were  recorded  with  the  permission  of  participants  and  subsequently transcribed by a professional transcription company. For  purposes of confidentiality, participants' names have not been used. The  research met the ethical requirements for research involving human  subjects stipulated by the authors’ institution.  2.1. Data analysis  The data analysis process followed  Miles and Huberman's (1994)  recommendations for conducting qualitative research. There were in  excess of 420 pages of interview transcripts and data from websites,  press releases and media announcements. The data were analysed using  a qualitative data analysis software package (NVivo) for the systematic  identification and analysis of data in search of themes. Strategies of  data reduction, data analysis, and conclusion and verification were  adopted ( Miles & Huberman, 1994 ). Handwritten field notes and  documents collected during site visits to producers also helped identify  initial themes. The major themes and their sub-themes resulting from  this analysis are presented in  Table 2 . \",\n",
              " '3. Methodology  3.1. Data collection  The sample for the study was drawn from the micro-task crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were recruited from the United States. The sample included respondents from  all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We  collected a total of 1256 useable responses: 618 from customers who  had stayed at an Airbnb in the last year, and 638 from customers who  had stayed at a hotel for the purpose of leisure in the last year. Separate  surveys were administrated for the Airbnb and hotel samples, and  guests traveling for business were excluded from the surveys.  3.2. Measures  Brand authenticity was measured using items from  Akbar and  Wymer (2017) . Object authenticity was measured using items adapted  from  Lalicic and Weismayer (2017)  and  Ramkissoon and Uysal (2011) .  Interpersonal authenticity was measured with items from  Yi et al.  (2017) , while intrapersonal authenticity was measured using items  from  Wallace, Buil, and Chernatony (2014) . Well-being and memorability were measured using scales from  Mody et al. (2017) . Brand love  was measured using  Carroll and Ahuvia’s (2006)  scale. Brand loyalty  was measured using four items from  Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman  (1996)  and  Hanks, Line, and Mattila (2016) . All items were measured  on 7-point Likert scales, and are presented in more detail in  Table 2 .  3.3. Analysis  The objective of the study is to offer a framework that delineates the  pathways through which authentic consumption experiences impact  the ultimate marketing goal of brand loyalty for hotels and Airbnb.  Thus, we used multiple-group SEM to analyze the data. For the first  stage in analyzing the data, descriptive statistics and distributions were  assessed. In the second stage, we conducted a confirmatory factor  analysis (CFA) on the constructs used in models 1 and 2 to test for  validity and reliability. The three components of consumption authenticity—brand authenticity, existential authenticity, and intrapersonal  authenticity—were modeled as second-order constructs, based on their  operationalization in previous studies and their conceptualization in  the present study ( Akbar & Wymer, 2017 ;  Mkono, 2013 ;  Morhart et al.,  2015 ;  Wallace et al., 2014 ;  Wang, 1999 ;  Yi et al., 2017 ), as discussed  and described in the literature review. The third stage of analysis  comprised structural modeling; we tested the two competing models  and compared them using nested model comparison procedures, including a chi-square difference test, an assessment of path significance,  and effect size testing. This allowed us to determine which of the two  models  better  explained the relationships between the various constructs. In the fourth stage of analysis, following a test of measurement  invariance, we used multiple group mediation analyses and pairwise  parameter comparisons to determine whether any of the structural  parameters were significantly different between the hotel and Airbnb  groups for the better model determined in the third stage. This allowed  us to further test the proposition of parallel pathways to brand loyalty. ',\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  This paper proposes an empirical study on Mediterranean cruise  destinations in the year 2015. The study is limited to those destinations  that received an amount equal to or larger than 500,000 passengers  during the year, which was analogous to the data compiled by Wild  ( Ramón, 2012 ). In this manner, cruise passengers constituted an important target group for the potential use of PT. For each port of call,  the PTH accessible with PT is determined and compared with the PTH  accessible with DT in relation to the following definitions and variables.  The potential itinerary (PI) is the route of travel from the point of  origin to the destination. The point of origin is the cruise terminal (CT)  located at the port of call (in cases where there is more than one  terminal, the terminal furthest from the tourist attraction was selected).  This study used two criteria for selecting the destination. Based on the  first criteria, only destinations declared as world heritage sites (WHSs)  by UNESCO were considered. This criterion was set owing to the large  number of tourist attractions in the Mediterranean, and the fact that  this international nomination provided the destination with an alternative attraction capacity when compared with the WHSs at the port  city. Based on the second criteria, the WHSs at the port-city are not  considered. The study is limited to destinations with a maximum  distance of 150 km from the CT, excluding port-city's WHSs.  The estimated travel time from the point of origin to the destination  (T ) is the time required for each itinerary, depending on the mode of  transport used (DT or PT), where T  is the total sum of estimated values  of time for each means of transport t(n), or that which is the same:  T  =  Σ t(n). During a leisure trip, the time invested in the journey to the  tourist attraction infers an inefficiency in the tourist experience ( Rus  Mendoza, Campos, & Nombela, 2003 ); therefore, the tourist will tend to  reduce it to a minimum. The number of changes in the means of  transport (N) is related to the success in the use of public transport. For  the DT mode, N = 1, as the displacement is direct and tourists use a  single means of transport, usually the ‘tourist bus’, while for PT, N ≥ 2,  as the first and last mode of travel is ‘on foot’.  The calculation of these variables is carried out using the Google  Maps platform. This has been used in studies on time and distance  ( Raknes & Hunskaar, 2014 ) in the design of vehicle routes ( Santos,  Coutinho-Rodrigues, & Antunes, 2011 ) through the development of its  cartographic technique ( Peterson, Dobson, Fandry, & Shrader, 2012 ).  Google Maps allows for the selection of different itinerary options by  varying means of transport: road vehicle, public transport, on foot,  bicycle, and plane. By entering the origin and destination data, the  platform designs an itinerary for each alternative and illustrates the  sequence of the transit mode and its T . In this study, the travel mode  ‘road vehicle’ is selected for DT, without choosing any of its avoidable  options (motorways, tolls, and ferries). For PT, the ‘transit’ mode is  selected and the available route options are ‘best route’, ‘fewer transfers’, and ‘less walking’. The route option selected is ‘best route’ as it  optimises the variables T  and N.  The Google Maps platform results correspond to the values obtained  in winter (22–26 January) between 09:00 and 10:00 a.m. The results  consider that the cruise ship would dock early in the morning in order  for tourists to have time to visit the WHSs in the hinterland. However,  for PT with T  < 60′, a second measurement is added for summer  (19–21 July) to compare the possible variations between the peak and  off-peak seasons. \",\n",
              " \"4. Methodology  4.1. Research strategy and setting  This exploratory research was conducted in a single setting, a  summer destination luxury beach resort located in Northern Greece, in  order to investigate how particular aspects of JS affect the level of  overall JS of the hotel's seasonal employees. The specific hotel was  chosen as the research setting because it meets the research objectives.  First, it is a luxury beach resort that operates seasonally (for a period of  six months, usually from mid April to mid October). Second, as the  initial contact with the Human Resource (HR) manager showed it has  an organized HR department with formally implemented HRM policies  regarding i.e. appraisal, training, staffing, and a strong customer-centric  culture with intense emphasis on quality service and customer satisfaction. In total, the hotel employs 400 people. Forty of them (10%),  located in the sales, accounting and HRM departments, are employed  all year round. The rest of the employees (360/90%) are seasonal and  have a diversified profile. In detail, 280 (77.7%) of the seasonal employees work at the hotel for 5–6 months. Most, of them live on unemployment benefit for the rest period of the year, whilst around 50%  usually return to the hotel for the next season. Lastly, 80 (mainly underskilled) employees (22.3%) join the hotel usually for 3–4 months,  working as waiters, bartenders etc. Third, convenience, referring to  easy access due to acquaintance with the hotel's HR manager, was also a  reason.  4.2. Research objectives  To address the gaps traced previously in the literature review section the objectives of this study are stated as follows:  1. Investigate the MSQ model structure in the hotel sector when it is  applied to a sample of seasonal employees in luxury summer season  resorts. This was considered as an important first step in the analysis  of the data since research evidence has showed that MSQ is not  transversal to employees of different national cultures or different  sectors and thus researchers have suggested that the users of the  MSQ short-version should conduct a factor analysis to examine the  factor structure for their sample ( Hancer & George, 2003 ).  2. Apply, for the first time in the hotel sector, the MUSA method to:  i) Explore the level of seasonal employees' JS in a summer destination luxury resort.  ii) Evaluate the importance/significance of the identified factors  (MSQ factor structure) of JS in forming the overall JS level of  seasonal employees.  3. Demonstrate how MUSA can support effective decision making in  the area of human resource management.  4.3. Data collection procedure and research instrument  To increase face validity, getting feedback on the items incorporated  in the questionnaire was considered important. Thus, a sample of 10  employees from different departments, levels and educational background was conducted. However, only 5 employees accepted to participate. No items were reported to be difficult, ambiguous or inconsistent. The survey took place in October 2016. During the data  collection period 216 seasonal employees were employed at the hotel.  Totally, 196 useable questionnaires (91%) were received. Based on the  data that has been gathered 53.1% of the participants were women and  46,9% men. Additionally, 69.9% were under the age of 40. More precisely, 25.4% of the employees were between 18 and 25 years old and  45.5% between 26 and 40. Moreover, 41.8% are high school graduates,  39.8% have university degree and 3.1% Master's degree. Most of the  employees have considerable work experience in the hotel sector since  over 57% have worked in the industry for over 3 years. 157 employees  (80.1%) have been working in the understudy hotel from 5 to 6 months,  100 of them (63.6%) declared that they would like to return to the hotel  for the next season. The rest of the participants, had joined the hotel for  3–4 months.  The questionnaire was divided into two parts. The first incorporated  employees’ demographic characteristics such as gender, age and education level. The second section included the MSQ short-version ( Weiss  et al., 1967 ). Additionally, an overall question related to JS was included in the questionnaire. A five-point response scale was developed,  ranging from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied).  To alleviate common method variance (CMV) ex ante and ex post  research strategies were implemented ( Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Lee, &  Podsakoff, 2003 ). Additionally, a web-based questionnaire was distributed  which  in  comparison  to  paper-and-pencil  instruments  ( Richman, Kiesler, Weisband, & Drasgow, 1999 ) deals more effectively  with the main sources of common method bias ( Podsakoff et al., 2003 ).  Moreover, the Harman's single factor test was applied. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  This qualitative research occurred within an interpretivist paradigm, which seeks to get inside people's  ‘ heads and hearts ’  ( Wearing &  Wearing, 2001 , p. 155) and understand their feelings and experiences.  A phenomenological approach was adopted, focusing on the subjective  experience of participants, who  ‘ offer narratives or provide general  accounts of events and situations from a particular perspective  –  namely, their own ’  ( Szarycz, 2009 , p. 49). A case study approach was  not considered to be appropriate, as the study only examined a narrow  aspect of the commemorative event that is the Centenary of World War  One, and then only in an Australian context.  In the Husserlian phenomenological tradition, the researcher sets  aside their preconceptions or suppositions in a process known as  epoche  or bracketing, in order to examine the phenomenon with fresh eyes  ( Creswell & Poth, 2018 ;  Szarycz, 2009 ). The researchers acknowledge  that they have been attendees of these types of exhibitions, with a  personal connection, having ancestors who fought in World War One  and having read books and viewed documentaries on the conflict. Attempts were made to bracket this experience, and concentrate on the  experiences as related by the participants. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that our interpretation of the findings is  ‘ based on the cultural,  social, gender, class, and personal politics that we bring to research ’  ( Creswell & Poth, 2018 , p. 228). This demonstration of self-reflexivity is  a hallmark of sincerity, and thus adds to the trustworthiness of the  study ( Tracy, 2010 ).  In-depth semi-structured interviews, lasting an hour on average,  were conducted with eight individuals involved in the organisation of  commemorative exhibitions across Australia that were staged as part of  the Centenary of World War One (hereafter referred to as  ‘ the  Centenary ’ ). Two participants worked for war memorials, while the rest  were employed by publicly funded and operated galleries or museums;  all of whom staged dark commemorative exhibitions as part of a rolling  programme that augmented their permanent collections. The individuals were either curators or directors/managers and had high levels of involvement in decisions made about the themes, content and  presentation of these exhibitions. A sample of this size is not uncommon  in a phenomenological study, given the requirement for a shared lived  experience which few people would collectively possess ( Szarycz,  2009 ). Purposive sampling was used. Searches of the Websites of publicly-owned museums and galleries throughout Australia identified the  exhibitions and then email contact was made with representatives involved in staging these exhibitions, asking for their agreement to be  interviewed or for another representative to be nominated.  Table 1  provides a summary of the participants, their position or role and the  organisations that they represented. Participants were given a pseudonym, P1-P8, to maintain confidentiality, which encouraged them to  be open and honest with their responses. For the same reason, which  also complied with university human ethics approval, demographic  details such as age, gender and ethnicity were not collected.  The interviews were designed to elicit detailed accounts of their  strategies and experiences connected to planning exhibitions under the  auspices of the Centenary, and pre-prepared questions acted as a  launching pad for discussion. They were deliberately framed in general  terms in order not to lead participants, and concepts such as empathy  were only mentioned after they were first discussed by the relevant  participant. An outline of the prompts used by the researchers conducting the interviews is provided in the supplemental section of the  online version of this article. The interviews were all conducted face-toface, at a venue chosen by the participants  –  usually a café or their  o ffi ce. Both researchers took part in each interview, sharing the questioning and note-taking, as well as the subsequent analysis of the data,  in a form of triangulation, which contributed to the trustworthiness of  the findings ( Tracy, 2010 ). Interviews were recorded and transcribed,  with a transcript subsequently sent to each participant, to allow for  member reflections ( Tracy, 2010 ). Any changes made by the participants were incorporated into the transcript before analysis began.  The researchers performed analysis of the data separately, in another form of triangulation, before meeting to compare the results and  discuss and resolve any differences in interpretation. Data analysis  began by reading each transcript holistically ( Lindseth & Norberg,  2004 ). The transcripts were then read through more closely, in order to  understand subtle details ( van Manen, 1997 ). Statements made by the  participants that were deemed to be significant by the researchers were  grouped initially into sub-themes, as a form of coding, and then assembled by the researchers into what were considered to be the main  themes. These themes were largely drawn from but not constrained by  the literature review, with the researchers open to what they might  discover ( Lindseth & Norberg, 2004 ); consistent with the research  paradigm and the methodological approach. In writing up the study,  thick description  through quotes from the participants has been provided, to allow their voices to come through and to give credibility to  the research findings ( Tracy, 2010 ). \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  Utilizing a naturalistic inquiry approach, the researchers undertook  a summative content analysis of national and sub-national tourism  policies from around the world. Researchers utilize a naturalistic approach to understand the social world through observation, description,  and interpretation of the experiences and actions of specific people or  groups of people ( Salk, 2010 ). Rather than beginning with a hypothesis,  researchers develop a general research question that serves as the  foundation for the inquiry ( Odom & Shuster, 1986 ). The most significant challenge related to a naturalistic inquiry approach is that two  researchers may draw different conclusions from examining the exact  same data.  Despite this challenge,  Lincoln and Guba (1985 , p. 35) suggest that  a naturalistic inquiry approach enables the researcher to undertake a  more meaningful enquiry, particularly related to social and/or behavioural inquiry, in three key areas: research, evaluation, and policy  analysis. The authors of this research contend that tourism policy reflects both social and behavioural aspects of specific people or groups of  people and therefore a naturalist enquiry approach was an appropriate  approach for this inquiry. A summative content analysis involves  counting and comparing through the utilization of keywords. It may  also involve the analysis of content ( Hsieh & Shannon, 2005 ).  From a tourism perspective, content analysis has been utilized in  past studies that involve the analysis of tourism policy documents. For  example, a study by  Whitford and Ruhanen (2010)  employed content  analysis to examine the government of Australia's State/Territorial  tourism policy in two key areas: 1) the development of indigenous  tourism policies; and, 2) sustainable tourism content within those policies. More recently and most applicable to this study,  Heslinga,  Groote, and Vanclay (2018)  applied content analysis to study the  changing aspects of tourism policy over time (1945–2015). Specifically,  they utilized this method to examine local documents from the Island of  Tershelling in the UNESCO World Heritage Wadden region in northern  Netherlands, in order to identify changes in the focus of these documents over time.  The credibility of the content analysis undertaken in this study is  two-fold. First, credibility is established by counting the prevalence of  key words and, second, credibility is demonstrated through the use of  quotes, phrases, and words drawn directly from the tourism policies.  We also provide a table that details the various tourism policies we  examined, including the weblinks (See  Appendix A ). From a reflexive  perspective, both researchers acknowledge that their past research and  personal values position them as environmentally conscious and concerned, particularly as it relates to the welfare and rights of both human  and non-human animals.  Overall, we examined 123 tourism policies and/or tourism development strategies (herein referred to as  policies ), representing a variety  of countries, territories, and provinces as found through an Internet  search conducted in the months of February and March of 2018. We  analyzed past policies and future oriented policies that spanned three  decades (1990s through to mid-2020s). Tourism policies that were focused solely on marketing were not included in this analysis; however,  some tourism policies focused on a variety of topics, including marketing. Such multi-focused policies were included in this analysis, at the  discretion of the researchers. After identifying policies that met the  requirements (e.g. mostly tourism development focused), we created a  list of initial key words to begin the content analysis. Utilizing the  “advanced search” option available through Adobe Acrobat we discovered the need to adjust our list of key words. For example, we initially searched for the key word “conservation” within the policies;  however, it quickly became apparent that “conservation” was always  connected with a “what” (i.e. conservation of species, wildlife, fauna,  flora). The same situation occurred with the key word “photography.”  Ultimately our initial list of key words was adjusted and 11 key words  were chosen for the analysis, as follows: animal, wild*(wildlife, wild  life), fauna, rights, resp*(respect, responsibility), welfare, species,  hunt* (hunting, hunters), fish*, angl* (angling, angler), exploit, and  protect* (protection). These key words were chosen by the researchers  as representing concern for the welfare of animals or encompassing  consumptive activities or perspectives that may demonstrate an anthropocentric focus within the policies.  Wherever possible, policies were downloaded and stored in electronic files for further analysis, as required. Some policies were not  downloadable and in such cases these policies were analyzed from their  various websites. The results of our policy analysis were stored in an  Excel document that detailed the country or territory's name, the policy  or strategy name, the year, if available, the website where the policy or  strategy was found. The Excel sheet was also used for recording key  word search results, and for making specific notes of interest during the  policy analysis stage. In some cases, a country or territory had multiple  tourism policies that spanned decades. For example, we located three  separate tourism policies for Tanzania covering the years 1999 through  to 2015. Similarly, we analyzed 10 policies emanating from within  India, covering the years 2002 through to 2017.  Overall, the content analysis of the tourism policies is focused in  two areas: 1) a key word search looking for evidence of what may be  deemed indicative of a concern for animal welfare and or rights, and; 2)  a content analysis search looking for evidence of progress toward or  away from greater concern for the welfare and rights of animals over  time. Regarding the latter, we searched both across countries and  within countries (where multiple country policies existed), over time. It  should be noted that while the focus of this paper is on searching for  evidence of animal welfare and rights, we include findings related to  the welfare and rights of the natural environment. This decision derives  from our contention that references to the natural environment include,  either explicitly or implicitly, references to animals that often share  such environments. We present the results of our analysis through  qualitative methods. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  3.1. Research design  This study data are collected during two phases. A series of face-toface interviews were undertaken in Phase 1 where nine participants  from the tidal bore destination management committee and the local  government o ffi ce were included. Each interview took between 30 and  45 min and were used to gain perspectives about three important conditions: (1) the possible negative consequences of tide-watching; (2) the  existing risk protecting behaviours that the destination has recommended; and (3) some important reasons why tide-watchers ’  adopting prevention behavior in the Qiantang River tide-watching attractions may be constrained or encouraged. Two main unfavorable  dangers were identified, namely,  “ hurt by the tidal bore ” , and  “ being  whirled away by the tidal bore ” . Three important self-protection actions  were,  “ watch the tidal bore behind the protection fences ” ,  “ follow the  instructions of the safety inspectors and yelling men ” , and  “ arrange  tidal bore watching activities based on the information of the o ffi cial  webpage ” . A survey was developed using the results of the interviews  and the literature. It was then sent to local government o ffi cers and  scholars for review to ensure its quality and clarity. Minor changes were  made based on the feedback.  Phase 2 involved an on-site survey among tide-watching visitors. A  group  of  trained  researchers  distributed  hardcopy  survey  questionnaires during the peak season in five tide-watching sites: Da Que  Kou, Yan Guan, Lao Yan Cang, Xiao Shan, and Hang Zhou City. All  these sites are major tide-watching locations along the Qiantang River  mentioned by interviewees, and normally contain around 250,000  visitors during the peak season. The convenience sampling technique  was used to recruit the participants. The questionnaire was written in  Chinese and the back-translation method was used to ensure translation  quality and content consistency.  3.2. Measurement  The survey instrument included questions related to the following  constructs: tide-watching visiting information, risk beliefs (namely,  perceived  vulnerability  and  perceived  severity),  e ffi cacy  beliefs  (namely, self-e ffi cacy and response-e ffi cacy), worry, sensation seeking,  self-protective behavior, and demographics.  Perceived vulnerability  is defined as the expectation of being exposed  to a threat ( Lwin & Saw, 2007 ). Two case-specific items in the perceived  vulnerability scale were identified from the interviews:  “ hurt by the  tidal bore ”  and  “ being whirled away by the tidal bore ” . The respondents  were asked to rate the likelihood of a risk event using a 7-point Likerttype scale (1 = extremely unlikely, 7 = extremely likely) ( Sharifpour,  Walters, Ritchie, & Winter 2014 ) ( α  = 0.807).  Risk severity  (also called perceived seriousness) refers to the degree  of negative consequences an individual associates with an event  ( Hichang, 2010 ). Items in the perceived severity scale are aimed to  evaluate the respondents ’  belief in the severity of the threat ( Lwin &  Saw, 2007 ). Adapted from  Martin, Bender, and Raish (2007) , perceived  severity was measured by asking  “ how serious are the potential dangers  you might face in the tidal bore watching attraction ”  using a 7-point  Likert scale ranging from  “ 1 = not at all serious ”  to  “ 7 = extremely  serious ” .  To measure  self-e ffi cacy  ( Bandura, 1990 ), the respondents were  asked to evaluate their confidence in dealing with incidents ( Rimal &  Real,  2003 ) (1 = not confident at  all, 7 = extremely  confident)  ( α  = 0.905).  To measure  response e ffi cacy , respondents were asked to evaluate  the effectiveness of multiple risk protecting behaviors that were identified from the interviews (e.g., tide-watching behind the fence, follow  instructions, and arrange activities based on o ffi cial information) using  a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 = not effective at all, 7 = most effective)  ( Martin et al., 2007 ) ( α  = 0.733). Additionally, to measure  the actual  self-protective behavior , we used a binomial scale (1 = yes, 2 = No) to  ask participants to indicate if they have undertaken these three risk  reduction behaviors.  To measure  worry  ( Chien et al., 2016 , see Section  2.3 ), participants  were asked to indicate how worried they were regarding the potential  risks related to tide-watching on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = not worried  at all, 7 = extremely worried) ( Larsen et al., 2009 ) ( α  = 0.815).  To measure  sensation seeking , we used the brief sensation seeking  scale (BSSS), comprising eight Likert-type items ( Hoyle, Stephenson,  Palmgreen, Lorch, & Donohew, 2002 ). The BSSS is a short form of  Zuckerman's 40-item SSS, and its validity and applicability have been  confirmed by previous studies in tourism ( Litvin, 2008 ) ( α  = 0.861).  Lastly,  the  participants ’  tide-watching  trip  information  and  demographics were collected. Participants were asked (1) if they were a first-time tide-watching visitor, (2) if they were local residents, (3)  which location they chose to watch Qiantang River tidal bore, (4) if  they had children accompanied the trip, and (5) if they could swim.  With respect to the demographic information, they were asked (1) age,  (2) gender, (3) education level, (4) marital status, and (5) family status  (i.e., have or have no children).  3.3. Data analysis  Cluster analysis was employed to answer the first research question.  Clustering that can form homogenous groups within a complex data set  ( Borgen, Barnett, & Gelso, 1987 ) is one of the most widely used tools for  exploratory data analysis. Our study thus identified targets that shared  similar types of risk perception attitudes and sensation seeking tendencies. This technique usually provides an analysis method that  combines all theoretical dimensions of risk perception attitudes. From a  practical perspective, cluster analysis can identify different target  groups whose needs and benefits vary. Such information can benefit  how practitioners devise the best strategy and campaign for visitor  safety ( Clatworthy, Buick, Hankins, Weinman, & Horne, 2005 ). Answering the second research question involved a series of mediation  analyses. \",\n",
              " \"2. Methodology  The study began by establishing the goal to answer the questions of  how water flowed in Pattaya Bay and how safe it was for people interested in swimming and other water sports. Since more tourists visited the beach during summer than rainy season, and as calm waves  were ideal for most water sports, the summer season (December to  March) was chosen as the water current evaluation period. Therefore,  all field surveys were undertaken from February to March 2018, in  order to represent the time when the local tourism industry was at its  peak. The collected data included bathymetric maps, tidal information  between 9 February 2018 and 10 March 2018, covering spring and  neap tides, and a 24-hr survey of water current flow characteristics.  After the information gathering process was completed, an evaluation  of the water currents in Pattaya Bay was undertaken using MIKE21 HD.  2.1. Data gathering  Bathymetric maps were collected from public nautical charts, as  well as information requested from the General Bathymetric Chart of  the Oceans (GEBCO) ( GEBCO, 2018 ). Furthermore, detailed bathymetry was surveyed by a professional echo-sounding team. The GEBCO  data was utilized to construct a map with a grid size of 200 × 200 m  ( Fig. 2 ), while the detailed bathymetric information was used to build a  local bathymetry having a grid size of 10 × 10 m ( Fig. 3 ). Tidal information at Chanthaburi station and Nakornsithamarat stations  ( Saengsupavanich, 2017 ), recorded between 9 February 2018 and 10  March 2018 ( Fig. 2 ), was collected from the Marine Department since  both stations served as a proper boundary condition of the Gulf of  Thailand. The tidal information at Pattaya Bay was also recorded  during this duration for calibration purposes ( Fig. 3 ). All data was referred to the national mean sea level (MSL). Since calibrating the water  level could not indicate how strong the water current flowed, an  Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was installed for 24 h to  measure the speed and direction of the water current. The 24-hr ADCP  data  was  adequate  for  the  water  current  calibration  process  ( Saengsupavanich, 2011a ,  2012 ,  2014 ,  2016 ,  2019 ).  2.2. Modeling procedures  MIKE21 HD is a general numerical modeling system for the simulation of water levels and flows in river and coastal areas ( DHI, 2018 ). It  has been applied in many studies in rivers, estuaries, and coastal areas  ( Babu, Vethamony, & Desa, 2005 ;  Hakim et al., 2015 ;  Lumborga &  Windelin, 2003 ;  Saengsupavanich, 2011a ,  2011b ,  2019 ;  Vethamony  et al., 2007 ). It is based on continuity and momentum equations (Eq.  (1)  to Eq.  (3) ).  (1)  (2)  (3)  where  is water depth (m),  is time-varying water  depth (m),  is surface elevation (m),  is flux density in  x-direction (m /s/m),  is flux density in y direction (m /s/m),   is Manning's number (m /s),  is gravitational acceleration (m/s ),   is wind friction factor,  is wind speed (m/s), is  a component of wind speed in x-direction (m/s), is a  component of wind speed in y-direction (m/s),  is a Coriolis  parameter which depends on latitude (s ), is atmospheric  pressure (kg/m/s ),  is density of water (kg/m ),  is time (s), and  are components of effective shear stress.  The analysis began by transforming field data into a format that  conformed with MIKE21 HD. Firstly, a bathymetric map with a grid size  of 200 × 200 m (called  “ coarse-grid ”  later on) was constructed in order  to simulate water current flow for the whole Gulf of Thailand. As the  coarse-grid simulation had only one open boundary ( Fig. 2 ), water level  variations at Chanthaburi station and Nakornsithamarat station were  used to create a line boundary condition. Differences among the water  levels of the stations forced the water to flow. The domain's initial  surface elevation was set to an average value of all water level stations  at the first time step. No atmospheric or wave forcings were added to  the simulations, because the actual water elevation at any time was a  summation of tidal water level, wave, wind, and other factors  ( Saengsupavanich, 2017 ). This research utilized the measured tidal  levels at the Chanthaburi and Nakornsithamarat stations, thus automatically including all factors occurring at the time. Adding other  forcings to the simulation would be redundant. The coarse-grid modeling was simulated between 9 February 2018 and 10 March 2018 with  a time step of 60 s, resulting in a maximum Courant Number of 8.35. At  the beginning of the simulation, both  and ) in the  domain were zero. Therefore, an additional model-day was undertaken  to warm up the simulation but was ignored during the flow analysis.  Calibration parameters used in MIKE21 HD, namely the Manning  number and the Eddy viscosity, were randomized. Once the calibration  result was satisfactory, the simulated water level at Pattaya Bay was  extracted to compare it with the measured one.  Another bathymetric map with a grid size of 10 × 10 m (called  “fine-grid ”  later on) was prepared to simulate the current flow in  Pattaya Bay. Since the fine-grid simulation had three open boundaries  ( Fig. 3 ), water level variations along them were extracted from the  coarse-grid simulation result (from 9 February 2018 to 10 March 2018).  There was no need to add more wind or wave forcings because they  were automatically included in the fine-grid simulation as they were  embedded in the boundaries extracted from the coarse-grid result. The  simulation time step of 2 s was selected, resulting in a maximum  Courant Number of 3.25. Simulations of extreme cases were not the  objective of this research, because it aimed to study the water current in  summer when the weather was calm and when the tourism industry  was at its peak. Finally, water current speed and direction at a specified  station were extracted and compared with those measured by the  ADCP, ensuring that the Pattaya Bay water current simulation was reliable. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  This study utilises VAR instead of the traditional econometric  models, which insu ffi ciently describe the dynamic relationship between  variables. By contrast, VAR can accurately capture dynamic variables  by using non-structural methods. Before using the impulse response  function of VAR, we need to test the stationarity and co-integration of  relevant variables. Therefore, we first use the augmented Dickey – Fuller  (ADF) test to examine stationarity and the augmented Engle – Granger  (AEG) test (two-step co-integration relationship test) to examine cointegration. Second, we use the Granger causality test to analyse the  causal relationship between SVI and tourists from the cities in Jiangsu  Province. Finally, we use the impulse response function of the VAR  model to reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of the dynamic  relationship between variables in different regions.  3.1. Vector auto-regressive model  Introduced in economic analysis in the 1980s, VAR is the basis for  the impulse response function. It is a type of non-structural equation  model that applies the prediction of time series multi-variables and the  dynamic effect of random disturbing variables to a system. VAR models  are well suited for application to many complex socioeconomic issues,  such as in the relationship between tourism and economic prosperity  (e.g.,  Kim, Chen, & Jang, 2006 ;  Kim & Kim, 2016 ), international trade  ( Khan, Toh, & Chua, 2005 ), and foreign direct investment ( Tang,  Selvanathan, & Selvanathan, 2007 ).  Using VAR to analyse the variation of dynamic multi-variables has  the following advantages: 1) the model is less constrained by theory  because all variables are treated as endogenous and are symmetrically  estimated in the equation; 2) it avoids default variables; and 3) it is  more convenient and intuitive to analyse long-term dynamic effects  between the SVI and tourists. A standard VAR model proposes in this  paper is as follows:  Z  =  A Z  +  A Z  +  …  +  A Z  +  ε ,  (1)  Where  Z  is a vector composed of two endogenous variables, that is,  Z = ( Y ,  BD );  Y ,  BD  is the SVI of Tianmu Lake from the cities in Jiangsu  Province and tourists respectively;  ε  is a two-dimensional random  perturbation vector;  p  is the lag order; and the 2 × 2 dimensional matrix  A ,  A ,  … ,  A  is the matrix to be estimated.  The Granger causality test confirms the promoting effect of tourism  development on local economic prosperity ( Tang & Tan, 2015 ); we thus  predict a correlation between search volume and actual tourist volume,  especially in the short to medium term.  3.2. Impulse response function  The impulse response function is used to investigate the dynamic  effect of one changed variable on the entire system, that is, the response  of the system to the impact or disturbance of one variable ( Götz, Hecq,  & Smeekes, 2016 ). In this study, only considering tourists of Tianmu  Lake as dependent variable, we try to figure out how deep influence  caused by a standard error of the SVI and the time gap it influenced. For  example, the VAR in this study has two variables:  Y  =  a Y  +  a Y  +  …  +  a Y  +  b B  +  b B  +  …  +  b B +  ε ,  (2)  B  =  c B  +  c B  +  …  +  c Y  +  d Y  +  d Y  +  …  +  d Y +  ε ,  (3)  Any change in  ε  will change the value of  Y  as well as all the future  values of  Y  and  B  by changing the system structure.  Impulse response analysis depicts the effects of an error term's impact when adding a standard deviation to the current and future value  of endogenous variables ( Pesaran, Schuermann, & Weiner, 2004 ). As an  interpretive tool for the VAR model, the impulse response describes the  reaction of the dynamic system at the time of an exogenous shock and  over subsequent points in time ( Cao, Li, & Song, 2017 ).

The introduction of the research site  Taizhou  (32°01′57″–33°10′59″N,  119°38′24″–120°32′20″E) is a  historical and cultural city, locates in the south of China. According to  the climate classification in China, Taizhou belongs to the hot-summer  and cold-winter region ( www.baidu.com/ .  (A, 2018) ) ( Fig. 2 ). The location of this city and the Taizhou Old Street are shown in  Fig. 3 , the  Taizhou Old Street is also registered as the cultural heritage. According  to the respond to the tourists, this block has a few disadvantages such as  the lack of urban vegetation and shade area, the utilization of a harden  ground and so on. These factors can affect the inner microclimate directly.  The annual average air temperature of Taizhou lies between 14.4 °C  and 15.1 °C. Recent climatic data shows that the air temperature in  summer can reach 38 °C ( tianqi.2345.com/we, 2345 ). Based on the  local weather station data, the city has experienced the highest average  air temperature in July.  Fig. 4  shows the detailed air temperature in  July.  In order to assure the accuracy of the measurement, the whole block  is divided into six parts in accordance with different spatial morphology  ( Fig. 5 ). The detailed information of the six selected points is shown in  Tables 1 and 2 .  The fisheye image at each selected sites are taken using a fisheye  lens and then input into the software (Envi-met) to calculate the simulated SVF ( Fig. 6 ) ( Yan et al., 2014 ).  2.2. The methodological framework  The methodological framework of this study is shown in  Fig. 7 . In  the diagraph, the field survey includes the measurement and questionnaire survey which are conducted in the same time to obtain the  microclimatic information of this area. Then parameterizing the corresponding model by using Envi-met 4.0. The on-site measurement are  carried out to validate the accuracy of the simulation performance by  liner regression. The output data from the software, including air  temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity and mean radiant temperature, are input into Envi-met as initial data for calculating the  thermal comfort index like PET. Consequently, the liner regression  analyses are conducted between PET and the percentage of the stages to  reveal the relationship. Through analyzing the PET and the questionnaire, we can find the thermal comfort range and neutral PET in  summer.  2.3. The micro-climate measurement  The measurement of outdoor microclimatic conditions are made  with mobile meteorological station ( Fig. 8 ) which can record the wind  velocity (m/s), air temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%) and the  instrument records the data every 1 min. The detailed information of  the station is in  Table 3 .  The measurement was carried out on July 28 and July 29, 2016 and  the data was recorded from 9:00am to 5:00pm (8 h). Besides the measured climatic parameter, it also refers to the published data by the  local meteorological station.  2.4. The questionnaire survey  The user's questionnaire survey can obtain the humans' subjective  outdoor thermal sensation and comfort sensation. The questionnaire  survey is adapted in many past studies and proved to have a high accuracy ( Lai, Guo, Hou, Lin, & Chen, 2014 ;  Lin, 2009 ;  Sharmin,  Steemers, & Matzarakis, 2015 ).  The whole questionnaire is divided into two parts. The first part is  about the subjective sensation of the microclimatic condition at the  time of the survey. The second part is about the tourist personal information including age, gender and so on. The scale of the questionnaire is in compliance with ASHARE-55 Standard ( Standard, 2013 ).  The basic question is the assessment of thermal sensation which is on  ASHARE 9-point scale (−4, very cold; −3, cold; −2, cool; −1, slightly  cool; 0, neutral; 1, slightly warm; 2, warm; 3, hot; 4, too hot) called  thermal sensation vote (TSV) ( Chen, Wen, Zhang, & Xiang, 2015 ;  Salata, Golasi, Vollaro, & Vollaro, 2016 ;  Villadiego & Velay-Dabat,  2014 ).  The questionnaire is written in Chinese and the interviewer are  conducted in randomly selected tourists who are passing by or visiting  the measured area where tourists will take almost 5 min to finish the  questionnaire. The detailed information about the questionnaire is  shown in  Table 4 .  2.5. The simulation  About the 3D microclimate modelling system, Envi-met was selected as the preferred modelling tool, mainly due to its capability in  the model foundation on the principles of computational fluid dynamics  for modelling plant-surface-atmosphere interaction in complex environment with buildings of different shapes, height, the material of the  street and the vegetation of different configuration ( http://www.envimet.info/ ,  2018 ). It can simulate with a high spatial and temporal resolution which supplies near-accurate modelling of micro-climatic  parameter.  In this model, the buildings including shading devices and artificial  structures are approximated to normal cubic, their sizes are configured  according to the Google maps and the measurement survey.  Envi-met has been widely applied in several studies. The accuracy of  Envi-met results accepted by researchers. These results have shown the  acceptable accuracy in different climatic model ( Middel et al., 2014 ).  The initial input data of the various meteorological elements used in the  Envi-met simulation is shown in  Table 5 .  In this study, the whole simulation is 48 h, starting from midnight  00:00, 28th, 2016 with a calculation of 1 min. The simulation results  are output into an hour basis. We obtain the data at 1.5 m high level.  The detailed information of all the paving material is shown in  Table 6 .  The three-dimensional model is shown in  Fig. 9 .  The material of the buildings in the block is brick, and the material's  color, emissivity and albedo is dark, 0.9 and 0.3. About the vegetation  in the model, plant and vegetation are not only symbolized as a porous  media to solar insolation and wind, but are treated as a biological body  which can be influenced by the evapotranspiration in the surrounding  environment. As Envi-met analyzes vegetation based on leaf area density (LAD) and not leaf area identity (LAI), equation which shows relationship between the two parameters ( Bruse & Fleer, 1998 ):  (1)  h is the height of the tree (m)  z is vertical grid size  LAI is the leaf area index  LAD is the leaf area density ( ). The tree models are provided  by Envi-met database. However, all modelling systems must be validated against field measurement to determine their ability in producing  accurate outputs within the urban environment. Therefore field measurements were conducted in this study to validate the simulated results  with the recorded data.  2.6. The thermal comfort index  There are many indices that evaluate humans' outdoor thermal  comfort, according to the previous research, Predicted mean vote  (PMV) ( Po, 1972 ), Standard Effective Temperature (SET) ( Gagge,  Fobelets, & Berglund, 1986 ), Effective Temperature (ET) ( de Dear et al.,  2000 ), Outdoor Standard Effective Temperature (OUT-SET) ( Spagnolo  & de Dear, 2003 ), Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) ( Ahmed  Mahmoud, 2011 ), Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) have  been widely used.  PET is a thermal comfort index which is based on physiological  energy balance in the human body and known as the air temperature  that makes the human body's thermal conditions in indoor environment  in balance with the body's skin and core temperature in complicated  outdoor environment, in addition, it has been developed in the context  of outdoor thermal sensation, as well as the research combining meteorological  measurement  and  questionnaire  survey  in  different  climates have been conducted, emphasizing the effect of psychological  variables on thermal sensation. The index is calculated for a 35 year old  man, 1.75 m tall, 75 kg weight, with a metabolic rate of 164.49 W/m and a clothing insulation of 0.9 m K/W ( Höppe, 1999 ). The required  parameters for calculating the index PET in the software Envi-met includes the air temperature, relative humidity, wind velocity, mean radiant temperature, human's clothing and activity.  As mentioned above, this study adopts physiologically equivalent  temperature (PET) ( Morakinyo, Ka-Lun Lau, Ren, & Ng, 2018 ) for determination of thermal comfort sensation. The corresponding values of  the new stages ( ) is shown in Eq.  (2) .  (2)  Where PET is the existing thermal situation in the pedestrian block;   is the new thermal comfort in the stages.   is the discrepancy  of  and . This equation can represent the thermal comfort  modification effect of the new reconstructed ways. \",\n",
              " \"3. Method  3.1. Fuzzy theory  Decision making has been debated as a complex and vague process  for many years. This vagueness, indeed makes various problems for  decision makers. In 1965, theory of “fuzzy set” has been introduced by  Zadeh (1965)  to facilitate decision makers' subjective judgments and  more general qualitative assessments. A number of fuzzy methods have  been applied as a decision making tool in several situations. According  to  Chou, Liu, Huang, Yih, and Han (2011) , gauging respondents’ opinion through Likert scale seems inadequate and too simple, owing to  the fact that human thinking is a fuzzy process and simple questionnaire design would not be able to fully reflect the feelings and  cognitions of the respondents. This is particularly the case for the  business model concept which is known as a vague and fuzzy concept  with no generally accepted definition ( Al-Debei & Avison, 2010 ;  Daft &  Albers, 2013 ;  Zott, Amit, & Massa, 2011 ). In this study, we propose  fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (FMCDM) to determine the  weights and ranking of designated business model criteria and subcriteria.  3.2. Fuzzy set and fuzzy numbers  It has been argued that human thinking is rarely based on numbers,  but the key elements deriving human thinking and judgments are linguistic terms or fuzzy set labels ( Bellman & Zadeh, 1970 ;  Zadeh, 1965 ).  A fuzzy set displays a continuum of grades of membership which ranges  between 0 and 1. As can be expected, a 0 value sign indicates that the  element does not belong to the set, and a 1 value sign indicates that the  element fully belongs to the set. Accordingly, the value which lies between 0 and 1 indicates a partial membership. Hence, fuzzy numbers  represent an extended confidence interval, and are fuzzy subsets of real  numbers. Fuzzy numbers can be displayed as triangular fuzzy number  (TFN) comprising three points:  = (l, m, u)  (1)  With l, m, u, indicating the smallest possible value, the most promising  value and the largest possible value, respectively. Eq.  (2)  represents a  triangular membership function for .  (2)  Several operators can be performed on TFN. Four basic operators  are listed below.  Assuming  = ( ) and = ( ), then:  (i) Addition  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (ii) Multiplication  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (iii) Subtraction  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (iv) Division of a TFN  :  = ( , , )  3.3. Fuzzy AHP  To solve multi-criteria problems in practical situations, AHP is  known as a common method. Developed by  Saaty (1977) , AHP have  been used in many disciplines. That is, scholars have used fuzzy concept  in conjunction with analytical hierarchy method. Primarily, the goal of  AHP is to evaluate experts' information, opinions and cognitions.  However, expressing these judgments in exact numbers seems to be  difficult due to the fuzzy nature of the language. It appears that  Chang’s  (1996)  fuzzy AHP and its extension analysis would act as a remedy to  tackle the abovementioned problem. The steps of Chang's extent analysis can be explained as follows.  Step 1 Let , , …, be extent analysis values for  i th goal in a  triangular fuzzy set, then the value of fuzzy synthetic extent  with respect to the  i th goal is defined as Eq.  (3) .  (3)  Assuming  = ( ), then  can be obtained using  fuzzy addition operator for the  m  extent analysis values:  (4)  In addition,   can be obtained using fuzzy addition  operator and fuzzy division operator as shown below:  (5)  (6)  Step 2 According to  Chang (1996) , at this stage, the degree of possibility of  being greater than  should be calculated. Let  =  ( ) and = ( ), then the degree of possibility of   = ( )   = ( ) can be defined as:  (7)  And for the TFN can be expressed as:  (8)  As shown in  Fig. 1 , d represents the largest possible value between  and  .  Step 3 According to Eq.  (9) , the calculation of possibility degree for a  convex fuzzy number S to be greater than  k  convex fuzzy  numbers can be defined:  (9)  Assuming d’ ( ) = min V ( ) for  k  = 1,2, …, n , then, as demonstrated in Eq.  (10) , the weight vector can be calculated:  (10)  Step 4 The weight vector calculated through step 3 represents fuzzy  weights. At this stage, defuzzification should be applied to obtain a non-fuzzy weight vector via normalization.  (11)  w  = ( d(A ),  d  ( A ), …,  d  (( A ))  3.4. The empirical procedure  Several steps have been taken to address the weights corresponding  to each criteria and sub-criteria for the airline business model.  3.4.1. Survey design  An in-depth review of literature related to business models, particularly business models in the airline industry have been conducted.  Based on a careful consideration of the extant literature, important  aspects and attributes of business models applied to the airline industry  including low-cost carriers have been identified. However, to further  validate the results of literature review, triangulation ( Jick, 1979 ;  Webb, Campbell, Schwartz, & Sechrest, 1966 ) have been applied.  Broadly defined, triangulation refers to “the combination of methodologies in the study of the same phenomenon” ( Denzin, 1978 , p.  291). It is assumed that multiple viewpoints would result in greater  accuracy. Accordingly,  Jick (1979 , p. 602) suggests “organizational  researchers can improve the accuracy of their judgments by collecting  different kinds of data bearing on the same phenomenon”. Therefore,  various viewpoints of a panel of ten experts in the fields of aviation and  transportation have been obtained in two phases. During phase one, the  selection of study criteria and sub-criteria have been validated, while  the second phase included a pairwise comparison questionnaire to  evaluate the relative importance of each criterion over another.  Due to the fuzzy nature of experts’ viewpoints, measurement instruments corresponding to each criterion followed the settings of fuzzy  theory including five levels: just equal, moderately more important,  strongly more important, very strongly more important, and absolutely  more important. The linguistic terms and their triangular fuzzy numbers are shown in  Table 3 . Moreover, sample questionnaire used in the  current study is presented in Appendix.  The interviewees were primarily asked about their opinion regarding the concept and significance of business model in the airline  industry. They were also asked about the opportunities to develop novel  business models in Iran's airline market. In addition, and more specifically, the interviewees were asked about their opinions regarding the  attributes and dimensions underlying a significant business model well  applicable to the airline industry. In addition, they were asked how  conditional and situational factors may affect the composition of business model elements. Other factors were also taken into consideration  during the interview in terms of low-cost carrier feasibility in Iran,  strategies to cope with new rivals in the market, significance of the  existing business models adapted by Iranian airlines. By the end of interview, the initial list of business model attributes was represented to  interviewees for their evaluative assessment and opinion. The initial  items passed experts' assessment.  Based on the results of experts’ interview, several dimension in  terms of market opportunity with respect to competitive market criteria, operation environment criteria with its corresponding sub-criteria  as well as knowledge management under value added processes criterion were subsequently added to the initial list identified from the  literature review.  3.4.2. Sampling and data collection  15 experts in the fields of aviation and transportation were contacted to get permission for interview and data collection. However, ten  accepted to participate in the survey. As stated earlier, in the first  round, experts were interviewed to obtain their opinions regarding the  importance and dimensions of airline business model in Iran. After a  through content analysis combined with the synthesis of relative literature, a list of criteria and sub-criteria have been identified.  Accordingly, a questionnaire was designed to gauge experts’ responses  about the relative importance of each criterion over another via pairwise comparison. Before the main survey, a pilot test was conducted,  which revealed that experts did not have difficulties in understanding  the questionnaire contents. Therefore, no changes were made to the  questionnaire for the main survey. The survey took two months with  ten useable responses. The features of experts participated in the survey  are represented in  Table 4 . \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Model  The findings of  Magee (1973) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee (1985) ,  Rose and  Yellen (1989) ,  Brissimis and Leventakis (1989) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and  Brooks (1999) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2004) ,  Narayan and  Narayan (2004) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2010) , and  BahmaniOskooee and Fariditavana (2016)  helped to constitute the theoretical  foundation of our study, as they all essentially focus on the association  between exchange rates and trade balances. In this model, trade balance is a function of bilateral exchange rate between two trading  countries and both countries’ incomes. We model the U.S. tourism trade  balance as a function of the bilateral exchange rate between the U.S.,  Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., and their respective income levels.  Specifically, the model can be defined as  (1)  where  TOB  is defined as the rate of outbound tourist departures from  the USA to its tourism partner country i divided by the inbound tourist  arrivals to the USA from the same country.,  EXC  is the bilateral exchange rate between the USD and trading partner country i's currency,  I  is the U.S. Industrial Production Indexes (IPI) (as proxy of income),  and its trading partner country i's Industrial Production Indexes (IPI) (as  proxy of income).  3.2. Sample and data  The U.S. tourism trade balance is measured by the rate of outbound  tourist departures from the U.S. to the three study trading partners,  divided by the inbound tourist arrivals to the U.S. from these countries.  Table 1  presents the bilateral tourism arrivals statistics between the  U.S.–Canada, the U.S.–Mexico, and the U.S.–U.K. country pairs, along  with the respective tourism balances between the pairs.  The exchange rate variable refers to the real bilateral exchange rate  between the U.S. and Canada's, Mexico's, and the U.K.’s currencies. In  the case of Mexico, for instance, one U.S. dollar is converted to its  amount in Mexican pesos in our dataset to analyze the effect of exchange rate depreciations and appreciations on the U.S. tourism trade  balance. The monthly data covers the1 period from January 1996–June  2017 and hence in each country pair sample there are 258 observations.  The year 1996 was chosen as the beginning of our sample period for  two reasons. First, data for the countries included in the sample of this  study were collectively only available from January 1996. Second, and  most importantly, Mexico's central bank made a major policy change by  switching to a freely floating exchange rate system in December 1994  ( Madura, 2011 ). Thus, including the period prior to 1996 would yield  inconsistent and biased estimates, since the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.  all previously adopted a freely floating exchange rate system.  The U.S. tourism trade balance data was obtained from the National  Travel and Tourism Office. The Industrial Production Index, which is  used as a proxy for income in the absence of monthly gross domestic  product data, was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  The nominal exchange rates and consumer price indices were also obtained from the database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Accordingly, the sample of this study consists of 774 country–month  observations.  The motivations for choosing the U.S. to examine the effect of exchange rates on the bilateral tourism trade balances with Canada,  Mexico, and the U.K. are numerous. First, the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency in the international trade marketplace. Second, Canada,  Mexico, and the U.S. are part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA), which is expected to increase bilateral trade between these countries. Third, the U.S. is one of the most developed  countries in the world alongside Canada and the U.K. Also, despite  economic differences, the U.S. is a major tourist destination for  Canadian, Mexican, and British tourists. Furthermore, former studies  examined the effect of exchange rate depreciations on the U.S. tourism  trade balance at an aggregate level (see e.g.,  Bahmani-Oskooee &  Brooks, 1999 ;  Cheng et al., 2013 ;  Chi, 2015 ;  Junz & Rhomberg, 1973 ).  Therefore, analyzing these effects at a disaggregate level in the context  of the U.S. allows us to compare our findings with those of previous  studies.  3.3. Empirical methodology  The stationarity of the variables needed to be tested prior to the  main functions of the study to analyze the effect of exchange rate on  tourism balances. In this context, we employed the Augmented  Dickey–Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron, and Zivot Andrews unit root tests  to determine the stationarity levels of the series included in our analyses. Test results showed that the series are stationary at I(1) levels at a  5% significance level. The results from the unit root tests are presented  on  Table 2 .  While there are several empirical models that can be employed to  analyze this relationship when the variables are not stationary at level I  (0), cointegration relationships between variables need to be examined  when the variables are not stationary in levels I(0), because a spurious  regression problem may occur if regression models like ordinary least  squares (OLS) are employed. Since the series in our sample are stationary at I(1) levels, we can employ both linear and nonlinear ARDL  cointegration and error-correction models (ECM) to examine the effect  of exchange rate on the U.S. tourism trade balances. Applying both the  linear and nonlinear ARDL cointegration and error-correction methods  allows us to more fully and accurately test the nature of the relationship  between the exchange rate and tourism trade balances, which could be  symmetric or asymmetric. The following estimation model, which was  developed by  Pesaran, Shin, and Smith (2001) , was used to estimate the  linear relationship between the exchange rate and tourism trade balance.  (2)  The logarithmic form of Equation  (2)  is presented as follows.  (3)  where  is the rate of outbound tourist departures from the U.S.  to the tourism partner country  i  at time  t,  divided by the inbound tourist  arrivals to the U.S. from the same country;  and  are the  incomes of the U.S. and its trading partner country  i  at time  t ; and   is the bilateral real exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and  its trading partner country  i 's currency at time  t , which is adjusted by  the respective consumer price indexes of the U.S. and its trading partners. While GDP deflator has been utilized in some tourism demand  studies (see e.g.,  Martins, Gan, & Ferreira-Lopes, 2017 ), majority of the  tourism demand studies utilize the CPI to adjust respective exchange  rates (see e.g.,  Dogru et al., 2017 .  The correlation coefficients for these country pairs are close to 1  (0.99911), suggesting a robust measure of bilateral exchange rate. The   and  are the USA's and its trading partner country i's Industrial  Production Indexes (IPI) (as proxy of income).  is the bilateral  real exchange rate between the USD and her trading partner country i's  currency.  = (CPIUSA*NEXi/CPI ), where NEX is the nominal exchange rate defined as the number of units of partner i's currency per  USD. CPIUSA and CPI  are the Consumer Price Indexes of the USA and  its trading partner country i.  We used the nonlinear ARDL cointegration and error-correction  methodologies developed by  Shin, Yu, and Greenwood-Nimmo (2014,  pp. 281–314)  to examine the nonlinear relationship between the exchange rate and tourism trade balance. The empirical specification of  this model has been adapted from the studies of  Bahmani-Oskooee and  Fariditavana (2016)  and  Bahmani-Oskooee et al. (2016) . The model is  specified as follows.  (4)  where short- ( ) and long-run ( ) coefficients in  EXC  denote depreciations ( NEG ative) and appreciations ( POS itive), respectively. Thus,  equation  (4)  can be written in the following form.  (5)  where  (6)  (7)  specified to capture the effects of positive and negative changes in the  US dollar on tourism trade balance. Positive coefficients of the short( ) and long-run (  ) indicate improvement of the US  tourism trade balance following the currency depreciations, whereas  positive coefficients of the short- (  ) and long-run ( ) indicate deterioration of the US tourism trade balance following the  currency appreciations.  The ARDL model allows the examination of the both long- and  short-run relationship between exchange rate and tourism balances. We  first test whether there is a long-run relationship between the exchange  rate and tourism balances, which is reported on  Tables 3 and 4 . The F  test, which is based on the studies of  Shin et al. (2014)  and  Pesaran  et al. (2001) , shows whether the dependent and independent variables  are jointly cointegrated (i.e., there is a long-term relationship between  the exchange rate and tourism balances). A statistically significant F test  suggests that the exchange rate and tourism balances are cointegrated,  supporting the long-run relationship between exchange rate and  tourism balances. We also examine whether the J-curve effect exist. For  this purpose, testing the short-run effect of exchange rate on tourism  balances employing an error-correction model (ECM) is necessary. The  “ECM ” shows the short-run effect of exchange rate on tourism balances. In the context of the J-curve theory, it shows whether the  tourism balances initially deteriorate following the depreciation of the  local currency. A negative and statistically significant “ECM ” suggests  that tourism balances initially worsens following the depreciation of the  local currency and hence provide support for the J-curve theory.  Otherwise, and insignificant “ECM ” indicate that tourism balances do  not worsen following the depreciation of the local currency. Rather,  tourism balances improve immediately following the depreciation of  the local currency and thus contradicting the J-curve theory's postulations. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Research design and process  To achieve the research objectives, an interpretivist research approach was adopted. The main purposes of the study were to explore  the specific environmental strategies adopted and to identify the  driving and restraining forces of environmental strategy adoption. A  purposive sampling method was used to recruit appropriate key  informants. Senior hotel managers of both international tourist hotels  and ordinary tourist hotels were invited to a semi-structured interview.  The purposive sampling method enables the researcher to select suitable participants who have the knowledge of the research topic so that  it would be of most benefit to answer the research questions and to  meet the research objectives ( Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2009 ). In  other words, the main aim of purposive sampling is to select participants who are particularly informative rather than being statistically  representative of the total population ( Patton, 2002 ). Although purposive sampling is a non-probability sampling method, it is considered  appropriate in the exploratory stages of research ( Saunders et al.,  2009 ).  Hotels in Taiwan can be divided into international tourist hotels and  ordinary tourist hotels ( TTB, 2017 ). International tourist hotels, based  on patterns of operations, can be distinguished into three sub-groups:  independent operations, domestic hotel chains and international hotel  chains, which can further be subdivided into franchise chains, management contract and membership ( Hwang & Chang, 2003 ). In order to  obtain a more comprehensive view of the current state of environment  strategy adoption in the hotel sector, this study includes both international tourist hotels and ordinary tourist hotels in the investigation.  3.2. Data analysis  Content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data. Content  analysis is  “ a multipurpose research method developed specifically for  investigating a broad spectrum of problems in which the content of  communication serves as the basis of inference ”  ( Cohen & Manion,  1994 , p. 55). It involves collecting, classifying, ordering, synthesising,  evaluating, and interpreting of the content of communication, and aims  to provide an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the phenomenon under inquiry ( Downe-Wamboldt, 1992 ). The method is widely  used for analysing qualitative research data such as speech, written  text, and interviews ( Patton, 2002 ). One key benefit of content analysis  is that it allows the researchers to generate frequencies from qualitative  data, while at the same time maintaining the richness of the data ( Veal,  2006 ).  When analysing the interview data, the three fundamental steps for  analysing qualitative data were adopted, namely: (1) unitising the data,  (2) categorising the data, and (3) contextualising the data ( Denzin &  Lincoln, 2000 ;  Maxwell, 1996 ;  McCracken, 1988 ). The first step was to  unitise the data into smaller pieces that could stand alone. The initial  coding process was guided by the literature review and the research  objectives of this study ( Bryman & Bell, 2007 ). The second step involved labelling and categorising of phenomena as indicated by the first  step. The third step was to contextualise the phenomena and to establish connections between each category in order to examine what  conditions caused the categories or the consequences that arise from the  categories.  3.3. Reliability and validity  Contrary to quantitative methods which focus on reliability and  validity, qualitative methods such as the semi-structured interview are  concerned with  “ trustworthiness ”  of data ( Franklin, Cody, & Ballan,  2010 ).  Lincoln and Guba (1985)  distinguish four criteria of trustworthiness: (1) credibility, (2) dependability, (3) transferability and (4)  confirmability, which correspond roughly to the positivist concepts of  internal validity, reliability, external validity and objectivity. In order  to ensure the trustworthiness of the analysis of semi-structured interview data, a number of measures were adopted, including audit trail,  member checking, and peer debriefing (independent coding).  An audit trail is a key strategy to enhance dependability of qualitative findings. It involves the systematic record keeping of the procedures and data relevant to the study ( Lincoln & Guba, 1985 ). In this  study, an audit trail was established by the researcher documenting the  research process through journaling of research activities and data  analysis procedures clearly. Member checking refers to channelling  researcher's interpretations back to the participants to ensure credibility  ( Lincoln & Guba, 1985 ). The researcher asked relevant questions during  the interview in order to assess whether participants' meanings were  interpreted precisely.  Peer debriefing is the process of engaging professional colleagues in  analytic discussions about data interpretation. After the data was coded  independently by the principal investigator and two research assistants,  a tourism/hospitality researcher was invited to serve as a peer debriefer  to check the accuracy and objectivity of the coding. Following the  procedures described by  Thomas (2004) , the peer debriefer was given  the research objectives and some of the interview transcripts. The peer  debriefer was then invited to create themes/categories from the transcripts. The themes/categories independently coded by the peer debriefer were then compared with the ones developed by the principal  investigator and research assistants. The percent agreement among the  four coders was 88% (average percent agreement = (88 + 89 + 87)  %/300 = 88%). Where disagreement occurred, the classification was  reviewed again and discussed until agreement was reached. In this way,  coding consistency was established.  3.4. Ethical considerations  With regard to ethical issues, interview participants were told that  their participation was completely voluntary, and they could withdraw  from the study at any time. The researcher assured participants that  their responses would be kept anonymous, and all information obtained  would be kept strictly confidential and be used for academic purposes  only. If the participants agreed to accept the interview invitation, they  were asked to sign a letter of consent. The researcher also sought participants ’  consent before digitally recording the interview. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  The hedonic literature ( Lancaster, 1966 ) provides a standard empirical setting for measuring the determinants of the value of a product.  Using a revealed preference approach based on actual price data, this  model infers consumers’ perception of quality differentials. This technique has been widely used in a variety of valuation issues, ranging  from housing ( Harding, Rosenthal, & Sirmans, 2003 ) to more sensorial  environments, such as wine evaluation ( Combris, Lecocq, & Visser,  1997 ). The model is popular in the tourism and hospitality domain  when assessing the determinants of price (see  Falk, 2008 ;  Rigall-ITorrent, R., &; Fluvià, 2011 ;  Ropero, 2011 ;  Abrate & Viglia, 2016 ) and  revenue performance (see  Hua & Yang, 2017 ).  Despite its diffusion, there is no evidence whether the pricing  strategy itself can create value for the firm, as suggested by  Dutta et al.  (2003) . The original formulation of the model considers a perfectly  competitive setting where price provides a natural measure of the  product's market value, and is thus the dependent variable. However,  with the increasing complexity of pricing strategies and the diffusion of  dynamic pricing, choosing a unique measure of price as a proxy for  value has become more difficult. Even more so in the case of perishable  assets, where unsold inventory must be accounted. This means that the  use of a traditional hedonic pricing model would be simplistic, as it  would not consider pricing as a key lever to maximize values. For example, in the case of a hotel (or an airline), the implicit value of an  available room (or seat) depends not only on the average price charged  for a night (or a flight) but also on the average occupancy rate.  Coherently with the argument above, this work proposes a shift  from the standard framework to a  hedonic revenue model  [1], where the  dependent variable ( R ) is a measure of  unit  revenue performance,  standardized over the available inventory capacity. On one hand, the  model includes a vector of variables ( P ) concerning the pricing strategy,  with particular reference to dynamic price variability. On the other  hand, explanatory variables include the group of qualitative attributes  ( H ) that would be typically included in a hedonic pricing setting.  (1)  The inclusion of pricing variables as explanatory rather than  dependent variables might raise causality concerns that need to be  addressed in each empirical model specification.  In order to test this proposed empirical model, the next section  presents a validation of the model in the hospitality industry.  3.1. Data  The empirical analysis consists of daily information on a sample of  840 hotels from 17 major European cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels,  Dublin, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Geneva, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Milan,  Moscow, Paris, Prague, Rome, Vienna and Zurich). Data was collected  for four consecutive weeks in April 2016 (thus, 28 booking dates for  each hotel). The final dataset originates from the matching of two  sources of information: i) public information available on the web from  an OTA and ii) access to a database offered by STR, an organization  specialized in hotel data storage for academia and business.  Booking.com, the most popular distribution channel for hotels, was  the selected OTA and provided the web-based information. As previously stressed, Booking. com operates through the agency model,  which leaves inventory and price decisions to single hotels, leading to  an environment with heterogeneous individual dynamic pricing strategies. Because the goal is to investigate the dynamic pricing strategies  adopted by each hotel ( i ), the same booking-date ( t  = 1 to 28) must be  observed for a repeated number of times to check the price variability  trajectory while approaching the check-in date. Data were collected by  simulating the booking process using different days in advance ( d  = 60,  45, 30, 20, 10, 4, 1 and 0 days in advance). Consistently with this, while  focusing on the month of April, the data collection process started at the  beginning of February. To standardize the simulated booking process,  the search concerned a single night reservation for one person. Each  query provides information on the best available price for each 3, 4 and  5 star hotel in the city center, in accordance with some activated filtering options in the web search engine.  This data collection strategy records price changes while approaching the booking date and this strategy offers insights on intertemporal price distribution. In this respect, for each hotel and date and  in order to capture the use of dynamic pricing strategies, we computed  the median value of the price charged together with two measures: the  intertemporal coefficient of price variation (CV) and the price changes  count (PCC).  Fig. 2  shows the distribution of CV in the sample. Most  observations are in the range between 0.05 and 0.125, while it is possible to see a small portion of hotel price observations without any  intertemporal price variability (around 6.5%). The median value is  equal to 0.099. This means that, if one considers a hotel room whose  average price on booking. com is 100 Euro, the available price is likely  to vary from 90 to 110 depending on the advance-booking horizon. CV  exceeds 0.3 only in the 5% of observations. In these cases, with the  same average price and advance-booking horizon as above, prices  would likely be in the 70–130 range.  Together with prices, the queries recorded data concerning some  hedonic characteristics that are available in the search page for all the  listings, i.e., the average online review score, the page position of the  listing on the OTA and the hotel class. These hedonic attributes have  been recognized by previous past hedonic literature in tourism. In  particular,  Yang, Park, and Hu (2018)  have shown, in a meta-analysis  study, the role of online reviews on performance indicators and  Abrate  and Viglia (2016)  have integrated reputational factors in tourism hedonic models. Additionally,  Ert and Fleischer (2016)  have disclosed the  impact of mere position effects in booking hotels online and  Melis and  Piga (2017)  have shown differential effects by putting hotel room class  into the picture.  The database collected from the OTA was then matched with daily  hotel performance data provided by the STR SHARE Center. The database integrates information on the amount of rooms sold per day  (daily occupancy rate) and the corresponding revenues, measured by  the  RevPar , i.e. the revenues per available room. This measure is  commonly used in the hospitality industry as a key performance indicator, because it expresses the average unit revenue per available  room and facilitates a direct comparison across hotels with different  size (see  Phillips, Barnes, Zigan, & Schegg, 2017 ). Different than a price  level, this measure also accounts for inventory sold (i.e. the occupancy  rate). The process of data matching was anonymized by STR to ensure  confidentiality and led to a final unbalanced panel database consisting  of 21,687 valid observations.  3.2. The empirical model  The hedonic revenue model is estimated using a panel data specification. Equation  (2)  presents the baseline model.  (2)  where:  In Equation  (2) ,  α  is a constant term,  β , and  β  are the vectors of  coefficients associated with the different groups of independent variables for hotel  i  in time  t , and  ε  are the error terms (given the dimension of the dataset,  i  = 1, …, 840 cross-sectional units observed for  dated periods  t  = 1, …, 28).  Specifically, the dependent variable is the  RevPar  (Revenue per  available room), taken in its logarithmic form. We adopt a semi-logarithmic panel data regression to reduce the impact of extreme values.  Consequently, the estimated coefficients are the percentage change in  revenues caused by a unit-change in each independent variable.  In the baseline model, the vector describing the pricing strategy  includes both a measure of price level, i.e. the median price level registered in the OTA, and a measure of price variability, i.e., the intertemporal coefficient of price variation,  CV  (or, in an alternative specification, the price changes count,  PCC ). The vector measuring hedonic  variables ( H ) includes the mean review rating, a dummy indicating  whether the hotel was on the first page of the search results from the  OTA ( first page ) and n-1 dummies regarding the STR hotel classification (luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper midscale, midscale and  economy class). In addition, the model includes city dummies to capture the geographical heterogeneity.  Table 1  shows summary statistics of the variables used in the analysis. The median price observation over the web was close to 250 Euros  per night. The CV is on average equal to 0.126, which means that prices  tend to move downward or upward by almost 13 percent with respect  to the mean price, depending on the time when a client makes the reservation for a certain hotel. The average review score measures the  perceived quality of the hotels. Its average is around 8.5 out of a  maximum of 10. The revenue performance indicates that each available  room pays off on average around 150 euros per night.  The hedonic revenue model could raise endogeneity concerns due to  the inclusion of pricing strategy as explanatory variables of unit revenues. In particular, the error term might be correlated with the alternative independent variables of interest proposed to pick up the level  (the  median ) and the dynamics ( CV  and  PCC ) of prices on the OTA. This  could happen if an unexpected event affects both performance and price  changes at the same time. For instance, the propensity to modify prices  can be greater when there is a higher than expected performance or  when the dynamics of the pricing strategy might be driven by changes  in macroeconomics variables that also have an impact on performance.  Price variability would be having an influence on performance, but  performance – and especially its evolution over time – would be having  an impact on the price variability. In particular, the error term  ε  can be  seen as the sum of two terms:  u , which is not correlated with  P , and  v ,  which is correlated with these price-related independent variables. The  latter term ( v ) captures the effect of all latent variables that could have  an impact on performance and the price-related variables.  To deal with and correct for this potential issue, we instrument  P .  When selecting the instruments, they must be correlated with these  variables but not correlated with the latent variables included in  v ( Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart, Lalive, & Day, 2012 ). Accordingly, we  propose the specific daily observation regarding the three variables to  be instrumented by their average values during the other 27 days of the  month:  The idea is that the pricing strategy in a specific booking date depends on contingent factors such as the specific daily performance,  while the monthly average does not depend on specific daily circumstances. Thus, according to the instrumental variables procedure, all the  independent variables are exogenous. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology and sample characterisation  The research was carried out at two beachfront 4 star hotels belonging to the Iberostar chain situated on Playa de Palma de Mallorca  (Spain). These hotels are included in the company's Iberostar Premium  category and target families with an average-high purchasing power.  They are renowned for the offering quality service, extensive entertainment programme and superb gastronomy that are the hallmarks  of all the brand's hotels. The company has impelemented a series of  brand improvement and co-creation actions such as the inclusion of a  Guest Manager, intra-stay surveys and digital communication circuits.  The fieldwork was conducted in the peak season, during the first week  of August 2016. During this period approximately 860 guests stayed at  the hotel, all of whom were invited to answer the survey. The response  rate was 70%.  A personal survey, conducted in the hotel complex itself, was used  to collect the information. It consisted of a structured questionnaire  comprising various scales adapted from literature to which a series of  questions were added in order to characterize the sample, which was  made up of 604 customers. In all cases, the latent variables analysed  were measured on a Likert-type response scale with 7 anchor points  where 1 represented  ‘ strongly disagree ’  and 7  ‘ strongly agree ’ . Three  versions of the questionnaire were used, in English, German and  Spanish, all translated by native speakers (back translation was used to  verify the accuracy of the translations). Furthermore, the scales were  pre-tested during a pilot phase.  Regarding the demographic profile of the sample, 54.8% of the  customers interviewed were women and 44% men, with an average age  of 40.91 years. The breakdown by nationality of the sample is as follows: 25.7% were German, 23.5% Spanish and 16.9% from the UK,  whilst other nationalities comprised the remaining 33.9%. Although for  84.9% of respondents it was the first time they had stayed at one of the  hotels included in the study, 36.8% had stayed at one of the chain's  hotels on a previous occasion. A mere 4.1% were travelling alone,  compared with 38.4% who were accompanied by their partner, 43.2%  as a family and 14.1% in a group. Regarding their booking habits,  36.1% had reserved their stay less than a month beforehand, 32.3%  between 1 and 2 months, 13.6% between 2 and 3 months and 16.7%  more than 3 months in advance. Finally, 52.2% of tourists booked the  hotel via a traditional travel agency, whilst the rest booked online.  The proposed model (see  Fig. 1 ), was estimated by means of a PLSSEM method using the SmartPLS program (v 3.2.7), which converged in  the fourth iteration.  The model is complex due to the existence of 3 s order constructs:  brand equity (BE); perception of value co-creation (CcV) and consumer  participation (CP).  To date, only a limited number of brand equity research projects  have adopted a formative approach to the conceptualisation of this  construct ( Delgado & Munuera, 2002 ;  Arnett, Laverie, & Meiers, 2003 ;  Buil et al., 2010 ;  Š eri ć  & Gil-Saura, 2012 ;  Buil et al., 2013 ;  Kam, So, &  King, n. d. ;  Martínez & Nishiyama, 2017 ). Indeed, much of the work in  this area has been based on first order formative models. However, the  use of higher models is appropriate when the constructs under analysis  are of a complex nature, considering each dimension as a major component, as this enhances the construct representation and provides a  more effective assessment method ( Buil et al., 2010 ). In our case, and  following the recommendation of  Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer  (2001)  regarding content validity and dimensionality, brand equity is  measured in accordance with four dimensions:  brand awareness, brand  associations, loyalty  and  perceived quality . The latter dimension is a  formative variable whilst the other three are reflective. In order to  measure customer loyalty and the awareness and association dimensions which for the purpose of our study were considered separately, we  adapted the scale proposed by  Yoo and Donthu (2001) , used previously  within the context of the hotel industry by  Hsu et al. (2012) . Perceived  service quality was measured on an  ad hoc  5 item scale based on elements that the hotel chain management team considered to be most  relevant in defining their service.  Perception of co-creation of value (CcV) is constructed formatively  in accordance with its four dimensions ( dialogue, access, risk and  transparency),  which were measured reflectively. Various authors have  also developed scales to operationalise its dimensions. Examples include those by  Taghizadeh et al. (2016)  or  Albinsson, Yasanthi Perera,  and Truly Sautter (2016) , who adjusted a previous version ( Albinsson,  B., & Sautter, 2011 ) used by  Braz Becker and de Brito Nagel (2013)  and  which we have adapted for the purpose of our research.  There are various uni and multi-dimensional forms of measuring  customer participation (e.g.  Chan et al., 2010 ;  Chen & Raab, 2017 ;  Uzkurt, 2010 ;  Yi, Nataraajan, & Gong, 2011 ). In this study we have used  three dimensions ( information seeking, information sharing and responsible  behaviour)  taken from the Yi & Gong scale ( 2013 ), which we consider to  be a reflective-reflective measure.  The remaining constructs, namely customer satisfaction (CS) and  perceived value (PV), are first order latent variables developed  ad hoc .  In order to measure perceived value we created two  ad hoc  items intended to reflect the trade-off between investment in terms of money,  time and effort  –  in other words the transaction value and value for  money. Overall customer satisfaction is measured by expectation disconfirmation, based on a single item scale. \",\n",
              " \"2. Methods  2.1. Sample collection  White shark muscle samples were collected from May 2012 to April  2017 at the Neptune Islands Group Marine Park, South Australia (including both North and South Neptune Islands), where free-swimming  sharks were targeted opportunistically throughout the year during  standard cage-diving operations. Sharks were attracted to the cagediving vessels using a combination of attractants (bait and chum  [mixture of minced bluefin tuna head, tails, gills and guts]) ( DEWNR,  2016 ;  Huveneers & Lloyd, 2017 ). Biopsies were taken from diving cages  or from above the water's surface using a single 20 mm rubber  speargun, with the end of the 1.3 m spear modified into a hollow 1 cm  diameter stainless steel biopsy probe ( Meyer, Fox, & Huveneers, 2018 ),  targeting the dorsal or upper flank musculature directly below the  dorsal fin. Biopsies were immediately frozen (−4 °C) and transported to  the laboratory where white muscle tissue was dissected from the subdermal tissue and skin. Tissue samples were weighed and freeze dried  prior to lipid extraction and analysis.  Individual sharks were identified ( Nazimi, Robbins, Schilds, &  Huveneers, 2018 ), sexed (based on clasper presence/absence), and  sized to the nearest 10 cm using visual size estimates ( May, Meyer,  Whitmarsh, & Huveneers, 2019 ). White sharks frequenting the Neptune  Islands are identified daily by cage-diving operators, enabling to record  the date each shark was first sighted, thus marking the start of their  tourism-exposed residency period. Telemetry was not appropriate to  determine residency in this context as relatively few (n = 7) biopsied  sharks were tagged and tags might have not been deployed at the beginning of the period of tourist-exposed residency. The amount of interaction between sharks and operators or number of days sighted by  cage-diving operators could not be reliably quantified due to the logistical challenges of operators accurately recording this level of detail.  We instead conservatively used residency at the Neptune Islands, defined as the period between first day sighted and day biopsied, acknowledging the limitation of using residency as a proxy for exposure  to cage-diving operations. Where possible, sharks that had spent several  weeks or more residing at the Neptune Islands, and those for which a  biopsy was previously collected, were preferentially targeted. Additionally, biochemical data from eight white sharks caught at other  locations throughout South Australia were also obtained ( Pethybridge,  Parrish, Bruce, Young, & Nichols, 2014 ). These were included in the  control group and considered not to have recently visited the Neptune  Islands.  Residency  was grouped into two categories (< 3 weeks [control] and > 3 weeks [tourism-exposed] at the Neptune Islands) as shifts  in FA profiles were noted within 3 weeks of a diet switch in captive Port  Jackson sharks  Heterodontus portjacksoni  ( Beckmann, Mitchell, Seuront  et al., 2013 ).  2.2. Biochemical analysis  Total lipid was extracted from freeze dried muscle samples  (minimum 12 mg dry weight [DW]) using the modified Bligh and Dyer  method ( Bligh & Dyer, 1959 ; described in detail in ( Meyer et al.,  2017 )). Briefly, the lipids were separated from proteins and carbohydrates using a solvent solution of dichloromethane, methanol, MilliQ  water. The total lipid extract (TLE) was then dried under nitrogen and  weighed prior to lipid class and FA analysis. Lipid classes [phospholipid  (PL), triacylglycerol (TAG), sterols (ST), wax esters (WE) and free fatty  acids (FFA)] were determined from an aliquot of the TLE using thin  layer chromatography coupled with a flame ionisation detector (TLCFID). Lipid class results were expressed as a relative proportion (percent  area) of the total lipid class compounds.  Individual FAs were separated from the glycerol backbones of the  polar and non-polar lipids in the TLE (not individual lipid classes) with  a heated methanol, hexane, and hydrochloric acid solvent scheme.  Subsequently, the FAs were identified and quantified using gas chromatography analysis using the Agilent Technologies 6890N GC (Palo  Alto, California, USA) with a HP-5 cross-linked methyl silicone fused  silica capillary column (50 × 0.32 mm i.d.), an FID, a splitless injector  and an Agilent Technologies 7683 Series auto-sampler. Quality checks,  including the addition of internal FA standard (C23 in each sample),  blank samples (each batch of 50), replicates (weekly) and gas chromatography - mas spectrophotometry checks on FAs (twice throughout  the analysis) were run to ensure accurate results and appropriate laboratory protocols. FA results were expressed as a proportion of the  total identified compounds. Out of the 61 fatty acids identified, only  those with means > 0.1% (24) were included in the subsequent statistical analyses.  2.3. Statistical analysis  We tested the influence of tourism-exposed residency ( residency  hereafter) at the Neptune Islands on white shark muscle lipid content,  lipid class, and FA profiles using multivariate statistical analyses undertaken  in  PRIMER7  +PERMANOVA  (Plymouth  Routines  in  Multivariate Ecological Research,  Clarke & Gorley, 2015 ). Permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) main tests with Monte Carlo  simulations (denoted as p(MC)) were run on Bray-Curtis similarity  matrices calculated from the square-root transformed profile data to  determine if  residency  significantly influenced the overall lipid content,  lipid class, and FA profiles. The lipid and FA profiles of the eight sharks  sampled outside of the Neptune Islands were compared (using PERMANOVAs) to the control sharks (< 3 weeks at the Neptune Isalnds).  Following non-significant (lipid content p(MC) = 0.847, lipid class p  (MC) = 0.617, FA p(MC) = 0.712) differences, these two groups were  combined. PERMANOVA models testing for differences between the  control (< 3 weeks and sharks from outside the Neptune Islands) and  tourism-exposed sharks (> 3 weeks at the Neptune Islands) included  sampling  season  to account for temporal variation in prey availability  and FA production ( Steeves et al., 2016 ) and  size  (total length) as a  continuous covariate to account for ontogenetic diet shifts ( Hussey  et al., 2012 ). Additionally, permutational analysis of multidimensional  dispersion (PERMDISP denoted at p(perm)) was used to determine the  relative amount and statistical significance of the dispersion within  residency  groups. The influence of  residency  (accounting for sampling  season  and shark  size)  was also investigated for select individual FAs  (reflecting either marine mammal or teleost consumption, or pelagic  foraging,  Table 2 ) using Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models  (GLMMs) fitted with gamma distribution and log link using the  glm  function and restricted maximum likelihood approach in the R statistical environment ( R Core Team, 2016 ). Significance for all statistical  tests was declared at p(MC) or p(perm) < 0.05.  As the 3-week threshold determined by  Beckmann et al. (2013a)  used captive Port Jackson sharks, it is uncertain whether this threshold  is directly applicable to white sharks in a natural setting. Furthermore,  Port Jackson sharks were not sampled prior to 3 weeks, so the turnover  rate may in fact be quicker. As such, all PERMANOVA and GLMM  analyses were repeated with  residency  groups < 1, 1–2, 2–3, and < 3  weeks; and < 2 weeks (control) and < 2 weeks (tourism-exposed); and  CAPs were run on these categorical  residency  groups along with the  CAPs of  residency  (days) as a continuous factor as reported below. Similarly, all GLMMs were run with  residency  as a continuous (days) or  categorical (grouped by week, and 2 week threshold as above). None of  the alternative groupings altered our findings and results from the < 3  week and < 3 week  residency  groupings are presented ( Fig. 1 ). To visualize and quantify shifts in lipid class and FA profiles across  residency ,  a Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) ( Anderson &  Willis, 2003 ) was run against  residency  (in days) as a continuous covariate. \",\n",
              " \"2. Methodology  2.1. Study design and underlying assumptions  1 This investigation consists of three consecutive methodological  parts, that aimed at investigating the relevant factors for allowing  citizens and destinations to adapt to climate change related increases of urban heat waves by fostering sustainable rural tourism in  the proximity of metropolitan areas. The three steps are listed below  and are explained in further detail by  Juschten et al. (2019) .  Qualitative Pre-Research Focus Groups with citizens and experts  aiming to explore relevant trends and behaviours. The analysis results  were used to inform the development of the quantitative survey and  broaden the diversity of topics to be covered.  Quantitative Surveys aiming to investigate both attitudes and behaviours of the source market (demand side) in terms of tourism travel  behaviour, adaptation intentions (based on the TPB framework) and  capacities (potential), and demand for mobility services.  Qualitative Future Workshops aiming to reflect the survey results  with two case study destination (supply side) by using a participatory  research designs. The discussion results were used to design adaptation  strategies to potential demand changes.  This investigation hence follows a mixed method design in order to  ensure that results include a variety of different perspectives on both  the demand and supply side and potential heat-related perceptions),  while at the same time producing representative and transferable results. According to  Hewlett and Brown (2018) , this pluralism is required to adequately address complex questions.  The heat-related change in intention to visit an SRD within Austria  (as a day trip, shorter or longer holiday) was the focal behaviour in this  study. A large tourism survey provided the data for the estimation of  the extended TPB model, covering the extensions identified in section  2.1 . Regarding possible extensions, it seems crucial to highlight that the  TPB assumes people to be rational agents performing reasoned actions  ( Bamberg et al., 2003 ). As  Knabe (2016, pp. 1 – 256)  puts it, the TPB  “ is  based on the assumption that humans are rational beings that make systematic judgments. The theory does not account for unconscious motives. ”  Since tourism decisions require a certain level of pre-planning, information and preparation, this assumption creates less limitations in  this context than it might for other consumption choices. However, it  still means that the TPB can only grasp the targeted potential influences  to the extent that people are aware of them and are able to articulate  them objectively ( Vogel, 1997 ). With that in mind, we aimed at identifying the most influential factors on behavioural intention by using  the theoretical model in  Fig. 2 .  2.2. Sampling procedure  A power analysis for sample size estimates was conducted in R using  pwr.f2.test {pwr}, based on the notations of  Cohen (1988) . The results  indicated that 204 participants are su ffi cient to detect even small effect  sizes (Cohen's f = 0.1 ) at a power of 0.95 and an  α  of 0.05. However,  a larger sample size seemed useful to enable group-specific analyses and  to enable predictions with small standard errors from the sample. The  survey conduction took place online between June and July 2017 and  was carried out by a large Austrian Online Access panel provider (with  approx. 100,000 participants). They contacted the panel members with  a short email containing the broad topic  “ Travelling ”  and a personalized link to the survey. The participation was restricted using quotas  for gender and age to ensure the representativeness of data concerning  these characteristics. No stratification according to education, occupation, income or spatial characteristics took place. The completion rate  of those starting the survey was 80.6% with an average completion time  of 20.4 min. The final sample encompasses 877 respondents (without  missing data for all TPB-relevant variables since all related questions  were required in the survey).  2.3. Online questionnaire in the source market Vienna  Table 1  shows all items relevant for the TPB-based hypotheses  testing. Topics 1 – 3 and 8 cover the core components of the TPB, topics  4 to 7 cover the extensions of the TPB model and topics 9 and 10 cover  the extension for the heat-related TPB model. Topic 11 comprises different socio-demographic data at person and household level beyond  the TPB. In order to guarantee the quality of the data this study  conducted a cognitive pre-test with 30 people (personally contacted by  the project team) and a technical pre-test with 77 people (already  drawn from the Online-Panel provider as part of the overall sample of  the main survey) to subsequently adjust and finalize the survey.  2.4. Data analysis: Structural equation modelling (SEM)  After cleaning and preparing the data for further analysis, a first  descriptive analysis took place comprising the distribution, means, and  standard deviations of all variables. After reviewing these results, an  exploratory analysis of all bivariate correlations was conducted in order  to gain first insights into the covariance structure and the relevance of  the presented hypotheses on the core and extended TPB variables. As a  prerequisite for the SEM, the normality for all relevant variables was  tested. Within the variables included in the model skewness ranges  from  − 1.314 to 1.463 and kurtosis ranges from  − 1.984 to 2.174, illustrating good normality according to the limits indicated by  Kline  (1998) . He suggested skewness to be between  − 2 and +2 and kurtosis  between  − 3 and +3. Afterwards, all relevant variables entered an  exploratory factor analysis in SPSS in order to test the strength of  generated constructs. The reliability of the constructs was tested in two  ways: Internal reliability using Cronbach's  α ; construct reliability using  composite reliability (C.R.). Chapter 4.1 presents the results.  The measurement of destination choice intentions was done using  SEM in AMOS, which represents a confirmatory approach. It aimed at  testing the causal relationships between the different constructs and the  general intention to visit SRDs in the future (INT_G). Given the complexity of the extended theoretical TPB model, we followed a systematic  procedure of path elimination and construct extension: First the core  model by Ajzen was built up and all variables with factor loadings  lower than 0.6 or insignificant path coe ffi cients were continuously  eliminated from the model. Afterwards, the additional constructs were  added one-by-one after verifying in equal measure their factor loadings,  path significances, and effects on the overall explained variance of the  model as well as the effect on Model Fit values. Chapter 4.2 contains the  results of the final model.  After completing the model explaining the general intention to visit  SRDs in the future, the model investigated the influence of heat on this  intention in an exploratory manner. Therefore, the construct of  “ heatrelated change of visit intention ”  (INT_H, topic 10 in  Table 1 ) was  added as an additional endogenous variable to the model. In doing so, it  treated the questions on this change of intention under the heat assumption as a stated response through a hypothetical intervention. Due  to the lack of literature on the relationship between heat and destination choice intentions, the analysis took place in an exploratory  manner. For this reason, we systematically analysed the bivariate correlation coe ffi cients of all variables with INT_H and tested them for  significance and influence on explained variance of INT_H. The variables included in this exploratory analysis but excluded from the SEM  due to lack of explanatory power are (i) home temperature, (ii) structural measures for heat avoidance at home, (iii) adaptation to heat with  regards to leisure activities, (iv) tourism behaviour, and (v) heat as a  travel motive. Chapter 4.2 shows the final model including all constructs with a significant influence on SRD visit intention.  2.5. Sample description in relation to the Viennese population  2 Due to the chosen recruitment method it was possible to set response quota, thereby allowing for a representative (Viennese) distribution regarding age and gender. All reference values for Vienna are  derived from publications based on the micro census of  “ Statistik  Austria ”  for 2015 ( Kaindl & Schipfer, 2017 ;  Stadt Wien, 2017 ;  Statistik  Austria, 2018 ). Based on this data we can observe a slight over-representation of highly educated people in the sample, which is partly  because the Viennese education statistics also contain people above 69,  who tend to have a lower level of education. Regarding the current  occupation, we can observe a slight over-representation of retired  people and those still completing their education. The Viennese population statistics were truncated to the age groups represented in the  sample (14 – 69 years). The age restriction was predetermined by the  pool of participants in the online-access panel provider who recruited  the respondents but is also underpinned by tourism studies for the  Austrian population which show a negative tendency in travel activities  for elderly people. This age distribution explains the higher proportion  of unemployed and the lower proportion of retired people in Vienna.  Table 2  illustrates the sociodemographic attributes. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Data collection  Intermediaries in the industry, such as OTAs and RS, provide a rich  database of consumer satisfaction levels, as expressed in publicly  available reviews.  The German hotel industry is characterized by a highly fragmented  market consisting mainly of small firms with limited marketing budgets. There are a total of 52,844 star-rated hotels in Germany  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). According to a study of the  German Tourism Association, 2.9 million people in Germany work in  the tourism industry, accounting for 7% of total employment and  generating 4.4% of the gross national product ( Deutscher Tourismus  Verband e.V., 2016 ).  Within the industry in Germany, domestic tourism plays an important role. In 2017, 366.4 million overnight stays in German hotels  can be traced back to German travelers, an increase of 2.8% compared  to 2015 ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). For a brief vacation, approximately three-quarters (75.2%) of Germans stay in their  own country ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). In 2010,  Germans traveling within their own country spent 221.3 billion euros  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ), and 47% of Germans  stated that hotels are their preferred accommodation when traveling  for at least one night in Germany ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V.,  2016 ).  At the same time, German tourists claim to be interested in the  ecological and social consequences of their travels. In a survey from  2014, funded by the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature  Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety, 31% of the German population considered the ecological sustainability of holiday travel to be  important, while 38% would like to travel in a socially sustainable  manner ( FUR Forschungsgemeinschaft Urlaub und Reisen e.V., 2014 ).  In a study from 2016, 49% of Germans stated that they would like their  holiday to be ecologically compatible, while 56% would like their  holiday to be socially compatible. Forty-four percent of German tourists  would like their holiday to be both socially and ecologically compatible  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ).  To assess the importance of sustainability orientation and specific  sustainability measures for tourists and to reveal possible differences,  we collected user-generated reviews for a set of selected hotels in  Germany. See  Fig. 1  for our data collection process. First, we identified  53 hotels throughout Germany that were part of a hotel corporation  engaging in sustainability management (sustainable hotels). Following  the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), a sustainable hotel  refers to a hotel implementing measures that fall into the four main  themes: “effective sustainability planning, maximizing social and economic benefits for the local community, enhancing cultural heritage,  and reducing negative impacts to the environment” ( Global Sustainable  Tourism Council, 2016 ).  Second, we assigned a conventional hotel, e.g., a hotel that does not  explicitly engage in sustainability management, to each of the sustainable hotels that was comparable with respect to location, size  (number of rooms) and star classification.  In contrast to previous studies analyzing reviews, we collected data  from multiple platforms to account for possible systematic differences  in aggregated review scores.  Booking.com , hrs.de, tripadvisor.de, and  holidaycheck.de were selected as platforms from which to collect online  reviews. Following  Xiang, Du, Ma, and Fan (2017) , the rationale for the  selection was three-fold: 1) they are the four largest platforms for reviews in the hospitality industry in Germany ( Warnecke, 2016 ) and  thus widely used, 2) they represent the two main types of platforms  collecting reviews in the hospitality industry in Germany, i.e., OTAs  ( booking.com ,  hrs.de)  and  RS  (tripadvisor.de,  holidaycheck.de)  ( Lorenzen, 2014 ;  Warnecke, 2016 ) and 3) they have already been frequently used as primary data sources in academic literature within the  hospitality field (e.g.,  Mellinas, Martinez Maria-Dolores, & Bernal  Garcia, 2015 ;  Payandeh, 2010 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ).  Guests’ ratings in reviews are a reliable indicator of customer satisfaction ( Gu & Ye, 2014 ;  Hargreaves, 2012 ;  Schuckert et al., 2015 ). To  gather the review data, we developed a web crawler to visit the review  sections of the aforementioned websites for each of the selected hotels.  From March 15th to April 2nd, 2016, the crawler gathered all available  reviews at a disaggregated level including review score, title, comment  and publication date. To address the research questions properly and  ensure comparability within the set of selected hotels, we decided to  only analyze reviews written between 2014 and 2016. Consequently,  we excluded older reviews, resulting in a dataset of 59,166 reviews. For  all collected reviews, basic linguistic features such as review length  were calculated. Due to the heterogeneity among the rating subcategories assessed by the four intermediaries, we use only the overall  review score as a proxy for customer satisfaction to ensure comparability. Because the selected online platforms use different scales to  assess overall customer satisfaction, we transformed the values to a  ercentage scale for comparison. After a final check for duplicates and  missing values, 52,493 full observations remained.  3.2. Data coding  This study uses content analysis to identify the sustainability aspects  observed and mentioned either explicitly or implicitly by a hotel guest  in an online review ( Millar & Sammons, 2006 ). In this context, sustainability reflects any sustainability measure or feature of hotel management that is either implemented or absent and can refer either favorably or negatively to sustainability following the GSTC criteria for  hotels. For example, the statement “I like that they offer regional and  organic food” refers to two categories of the GSTC Criteria for Hotels: 1)  “Local purchasing” and 2) “Sustainable Purchasing”, while the statement  “Too  many  individually  packaged  items  at  breakfast—unnecessary packaging waste” refers to the category “Efficient  purchasing/reduction of unnecessary packaging”.  Unlike previous studies, we decided not to use a text analytics tool  but to assign codes manually. These tools analyze frequent words or  themes but often fail to capture uncommon but relevant aspects ( Guo  et al., 2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ). By assigning codes manually, we believed we would be better able to capture the idiosyncrasies of the reviews and account for nuances. Because sustainability is a multifaceted  concept and people use many different words and descriptions to address it, it is very difficult to define pre-analysis what words hotel guests  might use when addressing sustainability aspects. Therefore, we believe  that despite the large number of reviews, in the case of sustainability, it  is a good choice to manually code the dataset to avoid the shortfalls of  text analytic tools and identify all sustainability aspects ( Geetha et al.,  2017 ).  Taking rare or infrequent words into account, we were able to reveal customer preferences. Moreover, we could capture specific guest  experiences that are uncommon but nevertheless offer a nuanced and  deeper view into the role of sustainability in online reviews and customer satisfaction.  To code the data, we used a pre-existing framework, the 27 “Global  Sustainable Tourism Criteria for Hotels and Tour Operators” developed  by the GSTC, an independent organization establishing and managing  global sustainable standards. Members include UN agencies, NGOs,  national and provincial governments, leading travel companies, hotels,  tour operators, individuals and communities ( Global Sustainable  Tourism Council, 2017 ). According to the GSTC, the criteria were developed “to provide a common understanding throughout the world of  ‘sustainable tourism’” ( Global Sustainable Tourism Council, 2017 ). A  comprehensive description of each criterion is provided by the GSTC  free of charge ( Global Sustainable Tourism Council, 2016 ).  To ensure reliability and overcome the possible biases of a single  coder procedure, we decided to follow  Lombard, Snyder-Duch, and  Bracken (2002)  and use an approach with two independent coders.  Both coders were given full access to the GSTC criteria, including  comprehensive descriptions of every code, and asked to read through  the descriptions carefully. Next, they were asked to use the descriptions  to assign codes to the reviews whenever they notice a sustainability  aspect in a review. Moreover, they were asked to distinguish between a  positive sentiment (a statement that praises either (1) the implementation of a certain sustainability measure or (2) how that measure is performed) or a negative sentiment (a statement that criticizes  (3) the absence of a sustainability measure or (4) how that measure is  performed or (5) the measure itself and/or its consequences).  Table 1  depicts coding examples for different sentiments.  To test the suitability of the selected coding scheme, both coders  initially coded a random sample of 10% of the dataset. On this basis, we  were able to expand the coding scheme to adequately capture the full  range of sustainability aspects found in the aforementioned sample. We  split the GSTC criteria category “Environmentally preferable purchasing” into two categories: food (Code 17) and other products (Code  18). We added Code 28 (Sustainability concept) because many consumers mentioned the sustainability measures of the hotel in a broad  sense, without referring explicitly to a specific “Sustainability management system” (Code 1, Sustainability management system, e.g.,  communication of certificates to guests). Because a number of people in  Germany are vegetarians/vegans, which means they do not eat meat  (vegetarians) or any animal products (vegans) ( Mensink, Lage Barbosa,  & Brettschneider, 2016 ), we added Code 29 (Vegetarian/vegan food).  This code is different from the other food-related codes (17 and 13)  because it includes persons who have special needs in regard to their  food for different reasons, including ethical ones.  Furthermore, we added Code 30 (Allergies/intolerances) to account  for the rising number of people with allergies to food, dust, mold, etc.  ( Zuberbier, 2016 ). We argue that this code is relevant in providing a  safe environment, as it extends the “barrier free” concept to other aspects of the hotel. Barriers in the literal sense of restricted mobility are  considered under Code 7 (Buildings and infrastructure). The extended  coding scheme is an important tool for future research addressing  sustainability aspects in eWOM.  In a second step, both coders independently coded the full dataset  using the revised version of the coding scheme.  Fig. 1  provides an  overview of the data collection process.  3.3. Assessing intercoder reliability  Following  Lombard et al. (2002) , two indices were chosen for the  assessment of intercoder reliability. Holsti's index was used to calculate  a measure for intercoder reliability for both the full set of coded reviews  and for each code of the framework. Because Holsti's method does not  account for agreements that occur simply by chance, Cohen's Kappa  was also calculated, as it accounts for chance agreement and is  generally seen as a more conservative index ( Lombard et al., 2002 ). The  results of the assessment of intercoder reliability are shown in  Table 2 .  Both indices lead to coefficients > 0.9 for the full set of coded reviews,  showing high intercoder reliability. However, 5 out of 24 codes assigned to reviews by the two coders show indices < 0.9 ranging from  0.79 to 0.88. In line with the literature, even the lowest scores for  specific codes in this dataset are regarded as acceptable ( Lombard et al.,  2002 ). Thus, all codes were included in the following analysis.  3.4. Analytical strategy  After coding the reviews, the subsequent quantitative analysis took  into account the following parameters: sustainability orientation of  hotels, number of reviews including sustainability aspects, number of  sustainability aspects mentioned in reviews, star classification and review score. Furthermore, we used a review platform and the size of the  hotel as control variables. The sustainability orientation is measured as  a binary variable, distinguishing hotels that engage in sustainable  management from their assigned conventional peers. The review  latform was also operationalized as a dummy-coded variable. The  reference group comprises reviews collected from the OTA hrs.de. For  each of the other platforms, a single binary variable was included. The  size of the hotels was measured by the number of rooms. Both the  number of rooms and the star classification were drawn from the hotel  website and checked against the data on the online platforms.  After a visual inspection of outliers via box plot diagrams, we excluded reviews with a rating < 0.2 from further analysis. Overall, a  total of 167 reviews were excluded due to this procedure. The remaining dataset consists of 52,326 reviews.  In the first step, we conducted multiple frequency analyses to assess  1) how many reviews include sustainability aspects, 2) which sustainability aspects are mentioned most frequently and 3) how sustainability  aspects are perceived. The aim was to provide initial insights into the  importance of sustainability aspects within the hospitality industry. In a  second step, we developed a linear regression model to assess 4) the  relationship between overall sustainability orientation and customer  satisfaction and 5) whether this relationship is contingent upon the star  rating of a hotel. Finally, we investigated how far specific sustainability  aspects contribute to customer satisfaction by conducting a two-step  statistical procedure following  Lu and Stepchenkova (2012)  to classify  each code into one of the four groups (satisfiers, dissatisfiers, criticals or  neutrals) proposed by  Cadotte and Turgeon (1988) . All analyses were  run using the statistical software IBM SPSS. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. Research model  The authenticity relationships between constructs as tested in this  study are based on  Bruner (1994) ,  Cohen (1988) ,  Wang (1999) , and  Kolar and Zabkar (2010) . Authenticity is a decisive variable that affects  tourist satisfaction, and has been researched in many previous studies  ( Chhabra et al., 2003 ;  Cho, 2009 ;  Cohen, 1988 ;  Naoi, 2004 ;  Waitt,  2000 ). Precedent studies ( Kozak & Rimmington, 2000 ;  Yuksel et al.,  2010 ) suggest that tourist satisfaction is a strong factor that affects  revisitation and willingness to recommend to others. Based on these  previous studies, the current study forms a multidimensional construct  of the stages of loyalty ( Back, 2005 ;  Back & Parks, 2003 ;  Evanschitzky &  Wunderlich, 2006 ;  Yuksel et al., 2010 ).  The major previous studies in the authenticy in the heritage tourism  studies ( Chhabra et al., 2003 ;  Cohen, 1988 ;  Kolar & Zabkar, 2010 ;  Poria  et al., 2003 ;  Shen et al., 2012 ;  Taylor, 2001 ;  Waitt, 2000 ) helped in  determining the theme of the hypotheses in the current study. As a  result, this study tackled five areas: (a) It measured the relationships  among the three factors of authenticity (objectivism, constructivism,  and existentialism); (b) It attempted to determine which one has the  most influence on authenticity; (c) It attempted to identify which one  has the most powerful influence on tourist satisfaction; (d) It explored  whether or not there is a significant relationship between tourist satisfaction and the factors of loyalty; and (e) It measured the relationships among the three factors of loyalty (cognitive loyalty, affective  loyalty, and conative loyalty). Along with the proposed conceptual relationship model (see  Fig. 1 ), the study tested five hypotheses:  H1: Object-based authenticity (that includes both objective authenticity and subjective authenticity) significantly influences existential authenticity;  H2: Authenticity significantly influences tourist satisfaction;  H3: Authenticity significantly influences tourist loyalty;  H4: Tourist satisfaction significantly influences tourist loyalty; and  H5: There are significant relationships among the different dimensions of tourist loyalty.  The research adopted a questionnaire survey methodology. The  questionnaire was designed based on a review of the literature and on  an examination of the specific characteristics of heritage tourism. It had  four parts: Part 1 measured authenticity (objective, constructive, and  existential authenticity) with 12 items; Part 2 used three items to  measure tourist satisfaction; Part 3 focused on the loyalty construct  associated with cognitive, affective and conative loyalty, and included  nine items; and finally, Part 4 reported on demographic information,  with eight items including age, gender, education, occupation, monthly  household income, number of visitation, type of accompany, and source  of information being covered. All items in the first three parts were  measured on a 7-point Likert-type scale from ‘strongly disagree (=1)’ to  ‘strongly agree (=7)’.  3.2. Data collection  The research site in this study was the Hahoe village in Andong city,  South Korea ( hereafter  Korea), one of the few places to successfully  preserve the unique residential architecture and distinctive village  structure of Korea's Joseon Dynasty (1392–1910 AD). The village is  authentic, still inhabited, and designated as a historic conservation  village by the Korean Government. The village was listed with UNESCO  as a World Cultural Heritage site in 2010. As the village is surrounded  by high mountains as well as a river it has never been invaded or  heavily damaged. It became well-known historically through a famous  local Confucian scholar, Ryu (1542–1607 AD), and there are a total of  176 resident families in the village based on the single Ryu family clan.  For the pilot study, 22 tourists who visited Hahoe village were  randomly interviewed and the questionnaire was then revised to ensure  reliability and content validity. The self-administered method was used  in the main data collection. The surveys were distributed by researchers  who understood the subject matter to visitors to Hahoe village (the  author and two Master degree students majoring in tourism management). A small gift (a packet of travel tissues) was given to each respondent to encourage participation, and the survey was conducted  inside Hahoe village for three weeks in October, one of the most popular tourism seasons of the year in Korea. Most respondents were given  the questionnaire in the concert gardens area, in rest areas, or at the  exit of the village, and it took about 10 min per person to complete. The  researchers stayed at Hahoe village for the entire survey period, to  secure enough time for data collection. Only those who showed a positive and friendly attitude to the researchers were selected for the  survey, and each respondent was given information about the survey's  purpose just before answering. While the respondents were completing  the survey, one of the researchers was standing by to answer any  queries.  Out of 593 surveys collected, 535 were used in the analysis after  excluding 58 that appeared to be incomplete. The collected data were  analyzed using the statistics packages SPSS 19.0 and AMOS 18.0.  Frequency, confirmatory factor, correlation and structural equation  model (SEM) analyses were conducted to test the proposed hypothetical  model. Confirmatory factor analysis is a rigorous method used to draw a  uni-dimensional, credible and valid result from the data.  Kline (2005)  notes that it is not necessary to use the data to remove certain variables  after an exploratory factor analysis has been performed to perform a  confirmatory factor analysis. Consequently, the study analyzed the  proposed hypothetical model by confirmatory factor analysis without a  prior exploratory factor analysis. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  Macau has long been called as the Les Vegas of the East, a destination where gaming-related industries were the backbone of the  economy. Over the past years, the Macau government and the local  community are attempting in diverging its industries. Apart from the  casinos, Macau is balancing the historical attractions with culture, local  cuisine, and tourism. Surprisingly, in an area of 30 km , there are 2284  restaurants featuring Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, and other international cuisines ( MGTO, 2018b ). One uniqueness of Macau is the Macanese cuisine, which is a blend of southern Chinese (especially Cantonese) and Portuguese cuisines. Building on the above advantages,  Macau has been listed as the UNESCO Creative City of Gastronomy  since 2017.  In order to discover the most popular cuisine on UGC and investigate how to effectively use social media to promote the designation  on the gastronomy, Macau was selected as the reference and Instagram  was analyzed. The current research employed a mixed method approach which is consisted by two phases of study. Phase I revealed the  type(s) of cuisine having higher popularity on Instagram. Quantitative  content analysis was conducted on the most popular Instagram accounts related to Macau food guides (i.e., foodie accounts). However,  after knowing the cuisines that attract the most interests, it becomes  timely for marketers to effectively do the promotion. Thus, semistructed interviews were conducted in Phase II based on the Brand Post  Popularity model, in an attempt to explore the opinions from Macau  residents towards the use of Instagram in promoting the Creative City of  Gastronomy.  3.1. Phase I  Phase I investigated what type of cuisine is the most popular on  Instagram by employing the quantitative content analysis with a specific purpose in discovering the relationship between different cuisine  types and the post popularity. Instagram was taken as reference since it  is a newly and popular tool in digital tourism ( Hanan & Putit, 2014 ) and  also  one  of  the  most  popular  UGCs  among  young  generation  ( Subrahmanyam et al., 2008 ). The first step is to determine the accounts that mainly promote and share their dining experiences or opinions towards the different dish types. Keywords such as “Macau food”,  “Macau foodie” and “Macau food lover” were used. Although the high  amounts of accounts are available, the number of the followers were  significantly different by comparing the top three accounts and the rest.  Thus, only accounts having the most followers were selected to minimize any potential bias on the number of “likes”/comments. Data collection was conducted in September 2018. The first account (A1) had  27K followers with 1604 posts, the second one (A2) had 19.7K followers with 2849 posts, and the third account (A3) had 17.9K followers  with 229 posts.  The targeted images of the current study are those posted from 2017  and afterwards since Macau has been designated as the creative city of  gastronomy only from 2017. A3 was excluded because the latest post  was published in 2016. Similar to the methods applied in previous  study analyzing the Facebook usage in the case of Italy ( Mariani et al.,  2016 ), images, the date of the post, number of “likes”, comments, and  hashtags were extracted from Instagram. The total number of posts  published after 2017 from the two selected accounts were 1536 and  were all extracted for the first round of screening. At the end, there  were 597 posts considered as irrelevant to the current study due to the  three main reasons: (1) contents or images were not related to the food,  (2) check-in location was outside of Macau, and (3) contents were  mainly for promotion (e.g. poster of the restaurant containing discounts/lucky draw for users who tag their friends). Finally, it resulted  in 939 posts. Following next, according to the categories listed on the  Macau Government Tourist Office (MGTO) official website, there are  four main cuisines; namely, Macanese, Chinese, International, and local  snacks. To be more specific, sub-categories were taken into account  with a total of 15 cuisine types ( Table 1 ). All the extracted images were  categorized by two researchers respectively. Inter-coding similarity was  tested by Cohen's Kappa to evaluate whether the images were assigned  to the same category ( McHugh, 2012 ). The result reached 0.93, suggesting an excellent reliability and consistency in the coding.  3.2. Phase II  Though Phase I revealed the most popular cuisine on Instagram, it  highlights the importance and urgency to understand how the promotion should be done in a more effective and efficient manner. Thus,  Phase II explored the opinions from Macau local residents with regards  to the use of Instagram in promoting Macau's designation as a Creative  City of Gastronomy. Currently, the Macau Government Tourism Office  (MGTO) ( http://en.macaotourism.gov.mo ) serves as the public entity in  charge of implementing, analyzing and assisting in formulating the  tourism policies to enhance Macau's reputation as a high quality destination. It also plays a crucial role in promoting, coordinating or facilitating a variety of tourism projects. MGTO is putting enormous efforts in promoting the authentic and various cuisine, and a four-year  plan as one of the formal members of UNESCO Creative City of  Gastronomy was realized. However, aside from the official website, the  current online platforms used by MGTO are limited and do not include  Instagram as one of the marketing tools. Hence, Instagram was chosen  as the focus seeing its popularity in the social media networks, which  evolved the mode of communication into visualization. With the huge  benefits and potentialities Instagram brought, MGTO is strongly encouraged to create an official account. Therefore, semi-structured indepth interviews were conducted to provide insights on how Instagram  can be used in destination branding. Similar to previous literature, this  study aims to gain an understanding of the underlying opinions rather  than building theories ( Bryman, 2016 ).  A non-random, purposive sampling approach was used with a focus  on young Instagram active users. According to the report from the  Statista ( https://www.statista.com ), one of the leading providers of  market and consumer data generated from more than 22K renowned  sources, users aged from 18 to 24 and 25–34 occupied 32% and 33%  respectively worldwide in 2018. Hence, the present study targeted the  two major groups of Instagram users. Specifically, the selection criteria  are (1) Macau residents, (2) daily Instagram users, (3) users between 18  and 34, and (4) users who follow at least one Macau foodie account.  The study focuses on Macau residents since they are more familiar with  the cuisine/promotions/advertising than tourists ( Zenker et al., 2017 ).  A well-cited literature claimed that local residents should be convinced  first for any government plan since the recognition from the local  community is deemed to have influence on the success of the plan  ( Jamal & Getz, 1995 ). Presuming that the MGTO is now developing an  official Instagram foodie account, if the residents are satisfied with the  performance, they are also likely to share this account or to tag their  friends and encourage them to travel to Macau and enjoy the cuisine.  Researchers approached potential participants around places nearby  the educational institutions and cafés. In any case, participants were  vetted to ensure that they met the criterion as mentioned above.  Additionally, to ensure that the interviewees are familiar with the  promotion or advertising on Instagram, only those who have already  fallowed some of the foodie accounts were invited to the interview.  Potential participants were acknowledged that the interview can take  up to 30 minutes. Upon agreements, participants left their email address for arranging the interview time. Interviews were conducted at  the location where interviewees preferred. The language used in the  interviews was either Cantonese Chinese or Mandarin Chinese depending on the preferences of the interviewees. The interviewer is bilingual in both languages to ensure that there is no language barrier or  misunderstanding throughout the whole process. The interview started  with basic questions related to the gastronomy tourism and consumer  behavior. The main instrument was developed based on the Brand Post  Popularity model to aid the discussion ( Vries et al., 2012 ). Finally, interviewees were asked to discuss comprehensively regarding their  overall suggestions to the Macau government. Follow-up questions  were asked accordingly during the interview.  Pilot interviews were conducted by the researchers in October 2018  with a sample size of 4 participants. After that, revisions were done to  ensure that all the questions are relevant and able to achieve the objectives of this study. 22 actual face-to-face interviews took place between October to November 2018. An informed consent form was obtained prior to the interview and no incentives were given to the  interviewees. Each interview was kept to a moderate length of time  (M = 00:24:02; SD = 00:03:47). The interviews were recorded by two  mobile devices while the interviewer was taking the notes. Finally, the  audio files in Chinese were transcribed and translated verbatim to  English. Interviewees are all residents in Macau.  Table 4  provides an  overview of their demographic profiles including age, gender, weekly  dining out frequency, the usage of social media, and the length of using  Instagram on a daily basis. Since the selected users in the certain age  groups are characterized by the use of social media, it is presumable  that the external validity is satisfactory and can be applied to a wider  population given the limited sample size ( Lennon, Rentfro, & Curran,  2012 ). Conventionally, thematic analysis is commonly used in social  science due to its flexibility and can be applied across different disciplines ( Braun & Clarke, 2013 ). Instead of exclusively using either the  deductive or inductive approach, the current study specially employed  a hybrid approach of thematic analysis ( Fereday & Muir-Cochrane,  2006 ). The analysis began with a deductive framework, and additional  topics/themes were added when the researchers encountered other  important aspects during the analysis. The manual coding process  started with a transcription and familiarizing with the data. A precoding scheme was built on the Brand Post Popularity model. As similar  outlined in the study of  Rice and Ezzy (1999) , the process of analysis  involved carefully reading and re-reading of the transcript to uncover  emerging patterns and themes within the data. Eventually, there are ten  main themes with 21 sub-themes in total ( Table 3 ). Themes were  agreed among the researchers prior to the coding process. Two researchers conducted the coding separately. Inter-coding similarity was  tested by Cohen's Kappa and reached 0.88, suggesting that the coding  was highly consistent. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  3.1. Samples  This  study  adopted  a  convenience,  non-probability  sampling  method with questionnaire surveys distributed in field studies. Due to  the conceptual integration of frontline employee and customer perceptions demonstrated in the model, and the intention to minimize  common method variance, a multi-sample research design was applied.  Data were collected from restaurant frontline employees and customers  from large main cities in China. In particular, employees provided information of job fit, employee orientation, job satisfaction, and organizational formalization. Customers completed questions on employee  incivility. The data collection of this study was completed with 873  usable employee responses and 2,619 usable customer responses from  44 casual or fine dining restaurants. Given that the focus of this study  was on the individual-level outcomes (i.e., interpersonal interactions  between employees and customers), employee and customer responses  were combined by matching one employee with three of his or her  customers. In particular, under each employee, the mean value of three  customer responses was calculated to form the composite value of  employee incivility rated by customers. As a result, the number of observations was counted according to the number of employees, which  was 873 in total.  Stevens' (1996)  principle of 15 observations to one  observed variable was employed to estimate the minimum sample size.  There were 24 items in this study. Thus, the minimum sample size was  required to be 360. The ratio of 36 observations per variable in this  study was more than twice the recommended threshold. As  Coppola,  D'Amato, Lorenzo, and Sibillo (2009)  emphasized, scholars need to go  beyond the suggested minimum sample size. The larger sample size in  this study increased the power to uncover true effects ( Henson &  Roberts, 2006 ) as well as the likelihood of generalizability ( Gallagher,  Ting, & Palmer, 2008 ).  3.2. Data collection  Before data collection, the purposes and benefits of this study were  explained to the restaurant managers. One or two weeks before the  survey administration, an e-mail invitation was circulated to managers.  The letter introduced the researchers, informed the purpose and importance of the study, explained the data collection process, signaled  management's endorsement for the study, and outlined confidentiality  procedures.  A contact person (a restaurant manager or his or her assistant) or a  research assistant was appointed to be present at each restaurant to  administer questionnaires personally to all participating employees and  to answer survey-related questions from employees and customers. The  participating employees received a survey packet that included a cover  letter, an employee questionnaire, and three customer questionnaires.  Each packet contained a special code that linked an employee, his or  her customers, and restaurant together. According to the instructions,  an employee first asked three of his or her customers to fill out the  customer questionnaires when customers were about to finish their  meals, and then the employee completed an employee questionnaire.  To guarantee anonymity and confidentiality, each questionnaire was  made sure to be enclosed in an envelope when distributed, sealed by the  person who completed the survey into a new envelope attached, and  then dropped into a secured survey collection box at restaurants.  3.3. Measures  This paper operationalized all variables in the model based on the  existing measures with minor wording modifications to fit the restaurant context. Unless otherwise noted, a seven-point Likert-type scale  was adopted, ranging from “1 = strongly disagree” to “7 = strongly  agree”. Items were coded in a way that the higher the score given, the  higher levels the variable ranked. The questionnaires were initially  compiled in English and then translated into Chinese, based on the  translation and back translation technique ( Brislin, 1980 ).  Employee orientation was measured using five items (e.g., “The  philosophy of our management emphasizes the human factor, how  people feel, etc.“), modified from  Zhang's (2010)  measurement. Job fit  was assessed using three-item  Donavan, Brown, and Mowen's (2004)  scale (e.g., “There is a good fit between my job and me”). Organizational formalization was measured based on five items (e.g., “This  restaurant has a large number of written rules and policies”), modified  from  Pugh et al.‘s (1968)  measurement. Job satisfaction was measured  using four-item  Hackman and Oldham’s (1975)  scale (e.g., “I am satisfied with working at this restaurant”). Finally, employee incivility  was assessed by customers using seven items (e.g., “The server doubted  your judgment”), modified from  Cortina, Magley, Williams, and  Langhout's (2001)  workplace incivility scale.  3.4. Data analysis  This paper employed a two-step approach to Structural Equation  Modeling (SEM) ( Anderson & Gerbing, 1988 ) to analyze the collected  data. The first step was to test the measurement model. In particular,  the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurements of each  variable were examined based on Cronbach's α, composite reliability  (CR), average variance extracted (AVE), square root values of AVEs,  and confirmative factor analysis (CFA). The quality of the structural  model was then tested by comparing competing models, and assessing  the regression coefficients of the hypothesized relationships. \",\n",
              " \"3. Method  In order to test our hypothesis, we carried out two experimental  studies. The first one (Pilot study), an online experiment, was a replication of the  Barcelos et al. (2018)  study. Since no other research  provided empirical evidence for the phenomena these authors demonstrate, and since it constitutes one of the main conceptual foundations  of the hypothesis we test in the present research, we decided to replicate it in order to verify if we could obtain similar results. As discussed, very few studies so far have explored concepts related to human  voice, or humanized communication, on social media. The purpose of  the pilot study was to show the influence of the hotel's tone of voice on  the hedonic value of the online experience and on customers' attitudes  ( Hypothesis 1 ), using psychometrical measures. In a replication effort,  we investigate the mediation role of hedonic value in the relationship  between tone of voice and consumers responses, however we focus on  consumer's brand attitude, not purchase intention, as investigated by  Barcelos et al. (2018) .  The second study (Main study), tested our second hypothesis and  was carried out in a laboratory equipped with an eye-tracking device.  This study used the same brand pages of the pilot study and had the  purpose of showing that the tone of voice can also influence the  browsing behavior of customers on the brand page, using measures of  eye fixation and cognitive load. As explained in the previous section, we  expected the increased emotions elicited using a human tone of voice to  make consumers’ patterns of information search more heuristic (or less  systematic) than the use of a corporate tone of voice.  3.1. Pilot study  3.1.1. Stimuli and procedure  The first experimental study in this research tested the influence of  human voice on the hedonic value of the online experience, and how  this hedonic value while interacting with the hotel brand page, mediates consumers' attitudes. For the context of the study we chose a hotel  since it is a typical service in the tourism sector about which customers  search online for other people's opinions before making a reservation.  We chose Facebook as the social medium for the studies due to its  widespread adoption and relevance to business today (Snyder, 2015).  We carried out an online experimental study (between-subject design)  in order to reproduce more closely the social media environment of the  research.  Similar to  Barcelos et al. (2018) , we showed participants two versions of a fictitious hotel Facebook brand page. The use of a fictitious  brand had the objective of testing participants’ reactions to human  voice without biases from previous attitudes towards brands. Participants were asked to imagine themselves going on a trip to New York  City and looking up Facebook for opinions about a hotel named “The  Whitaker Hotel New York”. Then, they were randomly assigned with  one of the two experimental conditions. Each participant was shown  one of two versions of the hotel brand page on Facebook (i.e., using a  human or corporate voice). After looking at the page for as long as they  wished, participants responded to a survey incorporating the measures  of interest in the study.  The two versions of the hotel brand page were identical, except for  the specific manipulations on human or corporate voice. Both pages  had the same number of likes and the same review evaluation (in stars).  The differences between the versions using human or corporate voice  were inspired by previous work relating language choices and feelings  of closeness/humanness ( Fournier, 1998 ;  Park & Cameron, 2014 ;  Park  & Lee, 2013 ; Sela, Wheeler & Sarial-Abi, 2012;  Steinmann et al., 2015 )  and consisted basically of choices of language and pictures that should  increase (vs. decrease) the perception of the brand as being more  human and close (see excerpts and general description of posts in  Appendix A ). For example, brand posts on the page using human voice  showed the profile picture of an employee, used informal language and  were occasionally signed by that employee, while brand posts on the  page using corporate voice showed the brand logo, used formal language and were signed just by the brand name. Each page had 29 posts,  11 being initiated by the brand and 18by consumers; 10 posts contained  pictures and 9 were text-only; 13 posts were primarily positive (compliments by customers or self-promotion by the hotel), 6 were primarily  negative (complaints by customers) and 10 were neutral (mostly  questions and answers). To improve realism, all posts and replies were  based on the content from the brand pages of real NYC hotels, however  with names, pictures, and personal details changed.  To improve the quality of the answers in our sample, we implemented some control measures. First, we inserted JavaScript code in  the online questionnaire allowing access only to notebooks and desktops, thus avoiding the problem of having participants look at reduced  versions of brand pages on small screens of mobile devices. Second, to  avoid using rushed answers that did not actually reflected participants’  opinions about the hotel, we inserted a hidden timer that measured how  long the participants looked at the brand pages. We discarded from the  final sample the answers of those who had not looked at the pages for at  least 15 s (16 participants).  3.1.2. Participants  We recruited participants using Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk).  Although it was not a requirement of the study, the use of MTurk also  had the benefit of allowing us to obtain a more representative sample of  the general population than a traditional sample of university students  (Minton et al., 2013). Participants received a link to the online questionnaire. The final sample (n = 88) comprised 35 women and 53 men,  aged 35.5 years on average (std dev = 11.4 years). In terms of education, 36.5% of participants completed high school, 17.3% had an associate degree, 42.3% had a bachelor's degree, and 3.8% had a graduate  degree. 85.5% of them had booked a hotel room at least once over the  last year, and 58.7% had booked between 2 and 5 times.  3.1.3. Measures  We measured consumers' attitude towards the hotel, hedonic value,  and their perception of human or corporate voice by the brand (manipulation check) using scales adapted from the literature (see items  and descriptive statistics in  Appendix B ). For control variables, besides  the usual demographic variables (gender, age, and education), we  measured participants’ enduring involvement with hotels, expertise in  hotels, and Facebook usage intensity (see scales in  Appendix B ). We also  included an attention question in the questionnaire and removed from  the sample the answers from two participants who did not comply (2 in  the pilot study, but none in the eye-tracking study). Finally, we included a hypothesis-guessing question at the end of the survey to assess  what participants thought was the purpose of the research. Responses  indicated that participants were not cognizant of the hypotheses in both  studies.  3.1.4. Results of the pilot study  Since the analysis included variables consisting of several items, we  used composite variables based on the mean scores of the items. The  manipulation of tone of voice (α = 0.89) was successful (M  = 4.49;  M  = 5.08; F (1, 87) = 4.95,  p  < .05). Perceptions of realism  (M = 5.83) and role-playing (M = 5.94) were satisfactory. Results from  ANCOVA analysis show a significant effect of tone of voice on hedonic  value (α = 0.95; M  = 4.23; M  = 4.72; F (1, 83) = 5.62,  p  < .05; see  Fig. 1 ) and a marginally significant effect of tone of voice  on attitude (α = 0.96; M  = 5.27; M  = 5.57; F (1, 83) = 3.90,  p  = .05; see  Fig. 1 ), confirming that participants looking at the brand  page using a human tone of voice had a more favorable attitude towards the brand, which also supports previous results ( Barcelos et al.,  2018 ). We did not observe any significant differences in the means of  the dependent variables in terms of gender, age, or education. However,  consumers’ involvement with hotels (α = 0.97; M = 4.74) was a significant covariable for hedonic value (b = 0.41; F (1, 83) = 22.07,  p  < .001). Facebook usage intensity (α = 0.30; M = 3.38) was also a  significant covariable for hedonic value (b = 0.28; F (1, 83) = 5.41,  p  < .05). The valence of the parameter estimates suggests that customers with higher involvement with hotels and heavy users of Facebook  experience more hedonic value on the brand page.  To test whether the hedonic value of the consumer's online experience mediated the relationship between tone of voice and consumers' attitude, we ran a mediational analysis using the PROCESS SPSS  macro (Hayes 2013; model 4 with 5000 bootstrapping samples). A  confidence interval (CI) that excludes zero for the indirect effect revealed that the hedonic value of the online experience indeed mediated  the relationship between human voice and consumers' attitude (95% CI  [0.07, 0.23]). The direct effect on consumers' attitude was not  significant (c’ = 0.25; t = 2.99,  p  < .01; see  Fig. 2 ) suggesting a full  mediation.  3.1.5. Discussion of pilot study  In accordance with our expectations and with  Barcelos et al. (2018) ,  the brand's use of human voice on social media increased the hedonic  value of the online experience for consumers. Moreover, consumers'  attitudes were more favorable towards the hotel when it used a human  voice. The findings also show that heavy Facebook users and consumers  with higher involvement with hotels experience more hedonic value on  the brand page. The positive influence of Facebook usage intensity was  expected, since this variable represents the importance of this social  medium in people's lives. Thus, intense Facebook users should get more  hedonic value when reading brand pages, and are likely to give more  importance to the posts they read. The positive influence of the level of  enduring involvement supports the findings of  Wang et al. (2007)  on  the relationship between hedonic value, involvement, and perceived  social character of websites.  3.2. Main study  3.2.1. Stimuli and procedure  The second experimental study tested the influence of human voice  on customers’ information search on social media using eye-tracking  measures in a laboratory setting. Eye-tracking is a means to observe  user cognitive processes and to find out how specific visual features  influence eye movement ( Renshaw, Finlay, Tyfa, & Ward, 2003 ). In this  sense, it not only reveals cognitive processing but also helps in detecting potentially more subtle information-salience effects. Accordingly, this study used eye-tracking to examine the influence of tone of  voice on information processing and explored the patterns of visualization on the hotel brand page.  As in the pilot study, participants in the laboratory setting were  asked to look at a hotel brand page on Facebook for as long as they  wished and then decide if they wanted to make a reservation. Each  participant was randomly assigned to one of the two versions of the  hotel brand page (using human or corporate voice). The two versions of  the hotel brand page were the same as in the pilot study, since the  manipulations of tone of voice had already been tested and validated.  We developed a script to guide the experiment and to ensure that all  participants were treated consistently. All participants were welcomed  at the lab by research assistants with a psychology background and  reminded of the requirements of the study (normal or corrected-tonormal vision). We also obtained informed consent from each participant. There was no direct contact between the main researchers and the  participants of the study for the whole duration of the study.  The experiment took place in three stages. First, the participants  completed an initial questionnaire about their personal characteristics.  Then, they were presented the hotel page on Facebook and we collected  eye-tracking data of their browsing behavior. The participants' eye  fixations, pupil diameter, and saccades were recorded with a Tobii X-60  eye-tracker (Tobii Technology AB). Fixations and saccades are the two  main types of eye movement. Variations in pupil size, according to  Laeng et al. (2012) , respond significantly to cognitive and emotional  arousal and are thus used in this research to identify areas of increased  cognitive processing. The areas can represent text being read, or other  elements being interpreted, for instance. Ambient illumination was  controlled and kept constant during the experiment in order to minimize pupil size variations due to light reflex. A nine-point calibration  was performed for all participants and was repeated until sufficient  accuracy was achieved. Stimuli were presented on a 22’ LG LED  monitor with a resolution of 1680 × 1050 pixels and a refresh rate of  60 Hz.  Several areas of interest (AOIs) were defined on the hotel brand  page to correspond to specific posts, pictures, or information on the  page Groups of AOIs were also created to include similar AOIs, such as  all replies or all profile pictures associated with a main post, for instance. These AOIs were later used to examine and compare measures  of fixation and cognitive load in greater detail.  Following the experiment, the participants completed a second  questionnaire collecting some measures of interest, including the manipulation check of the pilot study for comparison. They were then  thanked for their participation and given a $20 gift certificate as  compensation for completing the experiment. The average duration of  the three stages of the experiment itself (first questionnaire, eyetracking data collection and second questionnaire) was 18 min and 27 s,  but due to the time taken for welcoming, eye-tracking calibration, debriefing and compensation, participants stayed in the lab for half an  hour or more.  3.2.2. Participants  We recruited 30 participants for this experiment over a period of  two weeks. While the pilot study had no special requirements for the  participants, the use of eye-tracking equipment obliged them to have  normal or corrected-to-normal vision. For this reason, all participants  were pre-screened for glasses, laser eye surgery, astigmatism, epilepsy,  and neurological and psychiatric diagnoses. Moreover, since the procedures of the experiment required participants to come to the laboratory and stay for an extended period, most of them were either  undergraduate or graduate students from a major North American  university. On the other hand, this also resulted in a relatively more  homogenous sample, which was useful to potentially reduce personal  differences in patterns of information processing due to age, education,  or cultural characteristics. The sample comprised 16 women and 14  men, aged 26.8 years on average (std dev = 7.3 years). 16.7% of participants completed high school, 46.7% had a bachelor's degree, and  36.6% had a graduate degree. 90% of them had booked a hotel room at  least once over the last year, and 50% had booked between 2 and 5  times. More importantly, means of perception of human or corporate  voice by the brand were fairly similar between participants in the main  study and the pilot study, which assured the consistency of our manipulations (main study: M  = 4.56; M  = 5.03; pilot study:  M  = 4.49; M  = 5.08).  3.2.3. Measures  We used eye fixations, saccades, and pupil size as the basic data for  creating gaze heat maps (see  Table 1 ). Fixations were used for two  measures: time to first fixation (how long it takes before a participant  fixates an AOI or AOI group for the first time) and total fixation duration (the sum of the duration for all fixations within an AOI or AOI  group). Longer fixations indicate more time spent processing the AOI  information or relating the component in the interface to internalized  representations ( Wedel & Pieters, 2007 ). We also calculated the ratio  between the total fixation duration on AOIs and the total time on the  brand page (fixation ratio), since participants did not look at the brand  page for the same length of time, to allow further comparisons.  We also measured the number of saccades on the brand pages.  Dividing the number of saccades by the time spent on the brand page  provides the ratio of saccades per second (saccade ratio), which represents how often participants were moving their attention from one  point to the other on the screen.  Pupil size was used in this research to estimate cognitive load, following the procedures described by  Courtemanche et al. (2017) . As  with other physiological signals, pupil dilation is subject to significant  interpersonal variations or instrumental inaccuracies, so absolute values cannot be used to compare data from multiple users. Instead, these  signals need to be corrected to account for the user's baseline ( Van den  Broek, van der Zwaag, Healey, Janssen, & Westerink, 2010 ). Following  the approach of  Courtemanche et al. (2017) , the results of pupil sizes  (provided by the Tobii X-60 eye-tracker) were normalized (z-scores)  using the mean and the standard deviation of the inferred values for all  of a user's measures of pupil size. This step also helps distinguish the  “physiologically significant” areas of an interface from neutral ones. In  this approach, physiologically unimportant fixations are not considered  in the subsequent accumulation step; only important physiological activity makes a contribution ( Courtemanche et al., 2017 ). The normalized measures of pupil size were used not only for comparison between  AOIs and versions of the hotel brand page, but also for creating heat  maps, together with fixation duration.

              " '2. Methodology  2.1. DCC-GARCH model  The econometric framework proposed to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism demand and yield curve spreads in the  destination country is the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model  introduced by  Engle (2002) . As part of a two-step process, first a generalised autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is utilised to  generate standardized residuals. These inputs form the information set  used to estimate DCC model coe ffi cients. As such, the DCC-GARCH  model avoids the computational complexities of multivariate GARCH  models given that the number of coe ffi cients estimated to generate  conditional correlation estimates does not depend on the  “ number of  series to be correlated ”  ( Engle, 2002 ).  The use of GARCH models on international tourism demand is an  increasingly common feature in the tourism literature ( Chan, Lim, &  McAleer, 2005 ;  Shareef & McAleer, 2005 ,  2007 ,  2008 , to list a few).  Evidence of volatility clusters along with leptokurtosis and skewness  observed with tourism demand motivates its use for the purpose of this  study ( Lorde & Moore, 2008a ;  2008b ). On the other hand, the use of  GARCH models on the term structure of interest rates is motivated by  the same stylized characteristics of volatility persistence, skewness and  leptokurtosis identified by previous studies on the fixed income markets  ( Alizadeh & Gabrielsen, 2013 ;  Hibbert, Pavlova, Barber, & Dandapani,  2011 ). Therefore within this framework, correlation estimates ( )  being time varying, is conditional on past information denoted as  so that  . As such, this represents a stylized fact that differs from  the Constant Conditional Correlation Model of  Chang, Khamkaew,  Tansuchat and McAleer (2011 ).  Hence, the multivariate GARCH( p,q ) model for inbound tourism  demand ( d ) and the term structure of interest rates ( TSI ) of the destination country at time  t , is as follows:  (1)  where  is the vector of the data series  d  and  TSI ,  is the mean of and  denotes the vector of the error terms given the information set  . is the conditional variance-covariance matrix which is decomposed as follows according to  Engle ’ s (2002)  Dynamic Conditional  Correlation (DCC) GARCH model:  (2)  in which   is the diagonal matrix of the conditional  standard deviations obtained from a univariate GARCH(1,1) model. The  term  is the conditional correlation matrix, which is computed using:  (3)  where, is the conditional covariance between the two series and  is time varying correlation coe ffi cient that estimates the time  varying relationship between inbound tourist arrivals from each source  market and the term structure of interest rates.  If  then a positive relationship between inbound tourism  demand and yield curve spreads is observed. Consequently, a positive  (negative) shock to inbound tourism demand is an important driver  behind future economic conditions. Equally, it also implies that a shock  of equal sign to future economic conditions could have a significant  effect on tourist arrivals from the source markets. Whilst a negative  relationship observed  suggests that shocks to tourism demand and the term structure of interest rates have differential effect on  each other. Conversely, should tends towards zero, this implies  that there is little or no evidence of a common source of risk evident  and as such, shocks to tourism demand has no spillover effect on future  economic conditions and vice versa.

              " \"5. Methodology  This inquiry is situated within a constructivist epistemology, which  holds the belief that 'there is no meaning without a mind' ( Crotty, 1998 ,  pp. 8 – 9). In this view, the meaning is constructed from the interactions  between subject and object. Studies based on constructivist epistemology shift their focus from discovering the objective truth to the  meaning-making/constructing process ( Crotty, 1998 ). Consequently,  the constructivist view that 'culture is emergent thrives and is a part of  the process' ( Bruner, 2005a , p. 161).  Rich and in-depth information was collected through participant  observation, in-depth interviews, and secondary data. Participant observation has been widely applied in anthropology and has been considered as the principal approach for obtaining close familiarities with a  culture and its practices ( Kawulich, 2005 ). Thus, it has also been  broadly adopted for studying religions, such as by  Ryan and Gu (2010) ,  Wong et al. (2013) ,  Cynarski and Swider (2017) , and  Jiang et al.  (2018) , to increase understanding of the sacred world. Researchers'  focuses have varied between participation and observation, using participant observations to gain first-hand accounts of the activities of  people under study in their natural setting ( Kawulich, 2005 ). In actual field research, researchers can observe only a few specific issues.  Neuman and Robson (2014)  suggested three types of event sampling for  selecting objects, namely, routine, special, and unanticipated. Because  our first purpose is to understand how the Shaolin culture is represented; therefore, we sampled a routine event that happens every  day (from 7:00 a.m. to around 7:00 p.m., depending on tra ffi c conditions)  –  the most-popular daily mass-tourism visits to the Shaolin  Temple. We participated in the trip as ordinary tourists and paid particular attention to how the temple was introduced by the tour guide.  Photographs were taken to record what scenery and sites were introduced. Notes were jotted down about what was elaborated on and  how the trip was arranged. As  Neuman and Robson (2014)  highlighted,  “ pouring fresh memories into the notes  …  stimulates insightful reflection ”  (p. 326). At night, we first wrote down detailed notes on the activities of the day, and then reflected on our preliminary thoughts in  analytic memos. These memos assisted in formulating our analysis after  leaving the field.  We also visited a sub-temple by hiking for nearly 3 h. Surprisingly,  this physical exercises brought us mental peace before we conducted  interviews with monks, thereby increasing our understanding of the  Shaolin culture. The remote location of this sub-temple allows it to  reduce the influence of visitors. Two monks interviewed are from this  sub-temple. The interviews with three monks and a nun, not only added  a novelty value to our study; but also provided insight from the devout  Buddhist perspective on what Shaolin culture is and how it should be  represented. In total, 543 photographs were taken in our field work,  and later helped with recalling events during writing. Part of our participant-observation results are presented at the start of the findings  section. However, the most important function of these first-hand  experiences was in immersing us in the Shaolin culture.  In our field work, we collected brochures and electronic photos from  our participants and asked them to select one image as the most representative one. Subsequently, we searched the key words  “ Shaolin  trip/tourism ”  on Google to find different photos used by different  DMOs' websites, such as tourism administrations and travel agencies.  These secondary data helped our interpretation of the interviews.  We aimed to increase the understanding of how DMOs select and  negotiate with different identities of the Shaolin Temple in their representation process; thus, participants from local DMOs with rich experience in representing the temple fit perfectly with our interview  goals. Selecting cases with expertise and prior knowledge is termed  “ purposive sampling ” , and aims to gain deeper understanding rather  than to generalize the results to a large population ( Neuman & Robson,  2014 ). In addition to purposive sampling, snowball sampling was also  used to expand our local network. A Buddhist contact, who was a local  resident and had worked in the tourism industry for 20 years, generously helped us to reach out to local organisations that were active in  representing the temple. Some of them introduced other interviewee to  us as well, the so called  “ snowball ”  effect. Finally, sixteen members of  DMOs were invited to participate in in-depth interviews: four from  travel agencies, five from different levels of tourism administrations  (i.e. county, municipal, and provincial), two from Buddhism-themed  hotels, one from the management company of Songshan Scenic Attraction, one from the main temple, and three from sub-temples (see  Table 1 ). Two interviews were conducted after our field trip: one via  audio call and another via WeChat messages.  Tse (2016)  defined destination marketing organisations (DMOs) as  stakeholders, such as travel agents, hotels, governments, and attractions, who make the  “ effort to get people to visit the destination ”  (p.248). All the four types of stakeholders are included in our study. In  the Shaolin case, the tourism administration, as non-for-profits entities,  set up a specific marketing division to formulate o ffi cial-promotional  texts and lead campaigns for attractions within their territory, including, but not limited to the Shaolin Temple. The reputation of the  temple makes it a focal point of all three levels of administration. Travel  agencies and hotels introduce information about the temple with the  particular purpose of promoting their own services to visitors. The  temple itself is the attraction and has its own channels to spread information to its followers and the general public. Doubtless, coordination and cooperation among these stakeholders are necessary. For instance, some promotional events, such as the Shaolin International  Martial Arts Festival, are co-hosted by all the stakeholders.  Since the Tang Dynasty, the Shaolin Temple has included a number  of temples within and outside of Henan province as its sub-temples ( Su,  2016 ). The internal management of the temple is similar to a  ‘ family  structure ’ , which ensures that different sub-temples share the same  disciplines ( Su, 2016 ) and that monks and nuns are collectively deployed. The abbot of the main temple makes decisions about assigning  abbots, monks, and nuns, and provides different types of support for  sub-temples, such as renovation or funds. The sub-temples hold the flexibility of its own management, including setting up its own social  media channel to connect with its followers and deciding its own visiting policy.  Most participants were in charge of marketing and managing and  had extensive experience  –  more than ten years for twelve out of the  sixteen. For instance, four participants from travel agencies had been in  managerial positions for ten years, and all of them had worked as tour  guides who led groups around the temple for another ten years. Similar  rich backgrounds of experience were also notable in the government  o ffi cers. Two o ffi cers from the provincial government had worked in  the promotion of the provincial attractions for more than 30 years.  Moreover, they had worked in representing the temple almost since its  opening to tourists. Shaolin Temple is located in the Dengfeng County  of Zhengzhou Municipal City in Henan Province. With respect to the  managerial bureaus, we deliberately engaged with participants from  different levels. For example, among the five governmental o ffi cers, two  were from the provincial level, one was from the municipal level, and  two were from the county level. In addition to the monks, two other  participants were Buddhists.  Denzin and Lincoln (1998)  emphasised that one important criteria  for selecting participants is their willingness to share their genuine  opinions with the researcher. Some of our participants provided as  much information as they could because of their years-long partner  relationship with our local contact and the belief that discussing  Shaolin Temple issues in academic circles is also a way to promote it.  These factors enabled us to extend the discussion in depth, and the  average interview length was 61 min (This calculation does not include  the length of the interview via WeChat messages). Given our research  purposes, our interview questions are as follows: 1) What is the Shaolin  culture in your mind? 2) Which identities are selected to represent the  temple and how? 3) What factors contribute to the representation  process? These questions were followed by prompts.  Ten interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed. Four interviews with the monks and one interview with one government o ffi cer  were noted. One interview via WeChat messages was recorded in the  chat history. After the debriefing on the research purposes and how the  interviews will be used, participants provided us their oral consent to  participate. For confidentiality, the participants were assigned with  pseudonyms. All interviews were conducted in Mandarin Chinese, then  transcribed to and analysed in Chinese. All authors are fluent in both  Chinese and English, which ensured accurate transfer of findings into  this English manuscript.  In  Altheide and Johnson ’ s (2011)  reflections on interpretive adequacy in qualitative research, they highlighted that qualitative  “ researchers do not discount research from small samples, even a sample of  one — a case — but it is helpful if this information is available ”  (p.1104).  Therefore, the adequacy of qualitative research should not be based on  the number of participants, but on  “ the evidence appropriate for specific tastes and uses ”  ( Altheide & Johnson, 2011 , p. 1099). In our study,  we generated a rich and insightful picture of the representation of the  temple by deliberately inviting people with extensive experience from  different backgrounds (commercial and non-profit, mundane and  sacred, male and female). Some scholars also recommended novice  qualitative researchers with specific numbers, such as five to twenty- five participants by  Creswell (1998 , p. 64), and at least six by  Morse  (1994 , p.225). Aligned with these recommended numbers, our sixteen  interviews with average of 61 min are su ffi cient.  Content analysis that  ‘ examines patterns of symbolic meanings  within text, audio, visual, or other communication medium ’  ( Neuman &  Robson, 2014 , p. 20) was conducted for data analysis. This analysis is  closely aligned with and has been applied widely to cultural representation ( Buzinde et al., 2006 ). Unlike traditional grounded theory  that follows a strict process of  “ open, axial, and selective coding ” , the  current study engaged with the coding process with great flexibility. As  Parry and Johnson (2007)  noted, studies based on the post-positivism  paradigm tend to  ‘ de-contextualise, distil and otherwise simplify ’  (p.  120) research, whereas other research works contextualise and encompass the complexity. Therefore, we used more notes, questions, and  original sentences than a simple and brief code (or concept) in our  analysis. Those diverse labels broadly served to facilitate the authors'  thinking. The analysis process was facilitated by the qualitative analysis  software, Quirkos 1.5. Specifically, the software assisted the analysis in  three ways: marking and notes; searching on specific topics or notes;  and cooperation and communication with authors who are physically  located in different countries. For instance, the team could easily go  back to Chinese transcripts while preparing this English manuscript.  This means that the English writing has been compared with original  Chinese transcripts several times and by different authors, which increases the accuracy of our translations. Throughout the whole process,  the authors, not the software, directed the analysis.  Reliability and validity, which are the criteria of assessing positivist  research, are respectively replaced by trustworthiness and authenticity  in qualitative inquiry ( Altheide & Johnson, 2011 ;  Lincoln, Lynham, &  Cuba, 2011 ;  Neuman & Robson, 2014 ).  Altheide and Johnson (2011)  contested on using fixed and standardized criteria to evaluate qualitative studies as their quantitative counterpart. Trustworthiness indicates  consistency; specifically, in our study, we included three methods,  namely, in-depth interview, participant observation, and secondary  data, to confirm the findings from each method. In particular, we acquired first-hand experience via participant observation to improve our  own understanding of the Shaolin culture. In addition, some ideas in the findings, such as the integrity of the Shaolin culture, were introduced  and confirmed by several participants in separate interviews, which  demonstrated that some findings were consistent among participants.  “ Authenticity means giving a fair, honest, and balanced account of  social life ”  ( Neuman & Robson, 2014 , p. 145). In our inquiry, authenticity was achieved via at least three directions. Firstly, people from  different entities of DMOs and different worldviews were invited, with  detailed backgrounds as presented in  Table 1 . Secondly, many and long  direct quotations from participants were purposively used to remain  very close to the original data. Thirdly, detailed descriptions on our  methodology were provided to make our research process transparent. \",\n",
              " '4. Methodology  Consumer choice among a set of finite and discrete alternatives is  modeled typically under the random utility maximization (RUM)  paradigm. In particular, the utility derived by individual  n  for alternative  i  is specified as follows:  (1)  where  V  represents the observed part of the utility captured by a linear  combination of coe ffi cients  β  associated with  k  attributes  x  and  ε refers to the error term representing the unobserved part of the utility  assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( iid ) following  an extreme value distribution. Under the RUM paradigm, individuals  are expected to select the alternative  i  that maximizes their utility.  Considering that only part of the utility is observed, individual choices  can be predicted only up to a probability. Therefore, the probability  that  individual  n  chooses  alternative  i  is  equal  to  . Given the distributional assumption of the error term, the multinomial logit (MNL) choice probability  for a RUM model is computed conveniently as follows:  (2)  As previously discussed, the RRM paradigm is considered as an alternative decision rule assuming that individuals minimize the anticipated regret when selecting between alternatives ( Chorus et al., 2008 ).  Here, regret is intended as what the individual experiences when an  unchosen alternative performs better than the chosen one ( Chorus,  2010 ). Therefore, the assumption is that consumers aim to avoid regret  rather than seek utility when choosing among different products. Formally, the anticipated regret experienced by individual  n  for alternative  i  is specified as follows:  (3)  where  R  represents the observed regret,  β  refers to the coe ffi cient  associated with attribute  x , and  x  and  x  are the values of the attribute  k  for the considered alternative  i  and another alternative  j . The  unobserved regret is captured by the error term with its negative following an  iid  extreme value distribution. As indicated in the regret  function, a pairwise comparison is made for each attribute  k  between its  level in the considered alternative  i  and in any other alternative  j  in the  choice set. A close inspection of the utility and regret functions suggests  a fundamental conceptual difference in the decision-making process  assumed in the two approaches. In the utility-based approach, the individual is assumed to assess alternatives separately by attaching a  weight to each alternative attribute. The utility values, which are derived through summation, are then compared, and the alternative with  the highest value is selected. Therefore, the comparison between alternatives takes place at the aggregate level, making RUM models fully  compensatory. That is, a decrease in one alternative attribute can be  offset fully by an equal increase in another equally important attribute.  In the regret-based approach, the individual is assumed to assess alternatives collectively by attaching a weight to the differences between  attributes across all alternatives. The overall regret is obtained through  summation, and the alternative with the lowest value is selected.  Therefore, the alternatives are compared at both attribute and aggregate levels, making the RRM model semi-compensatory. That is, the  level of compensation needed to offset a decrease in one alternative  attribute depends on the relative performance of the attribute compared to the other alternatives.  Under the RRM paradigm, the probability that individual  n  selects  alternative  i  is  equal  to  .  Mathematically, minimizing the regret is equivalent to maximizing the  negative regret ( Chorus, 2010 ). Hence, the same probability can be  rewritten as  . Considering  the distributional assumption of the negative error, the MNL choice  probability of an RRM model can be computed conveniently as follows:  (4)  The extension of the MNL choice probabilities to account for  random preference heterogeneity and panel structure of the data (i.e.,  correlation across choice tasks for the same respondent) is straightforward, leading to the so-called mixed logit (MXL) probabilities ( Train,  2009 ). The MXL choice probabilities for the RUM and RRM models,  respectively, are specified as follows:  (5)  (6)  where  s  = 1,  … ,  S  refers to the choice tasks per respondent, and  f( β )  is a  density function typically specified to follow a normal distribution. The  integrals in equations  (5) and (6)  have no close form, and the choice  probability for MXL models are approximated through simulation. As  shown in the equations above, the MNL-RRM and MXL-RRM models  share the same type of choice probabilities of the MNL-RUM and MXLRUM models. This characteristic makes the RRM class of models easy to  estimate through maximum (simulated) likelihood estimator commonly  used in software packages for discrete choice analysis. In fact, investigation of the RRM models is reported in a growing number of  applications in several contexts, including transport mode choice ( Boeri  and Masiero, 2014 ;  Chorus, 2010 ;  Hensher et al., 2016 ;  Hess &  Stathopoulos, 2013 ;  Leong & Hensher, 2015 ), shopping-center choice  ( Chorus, 2010 ;  Rasouli & Timmermans, 2017 ) outdoor recreation site  choice ( Boeri, Longo, Doherty, & Hynes, 2012 ;  Thiene, Boeri, & Chorus,  2012 ), and leisure activities ( Dekker, Hess, Arentze, & Chorus, 2014 ).  Chorus, Rose, and Hensher (2013)  introduced a hybrid model specification where attributes are processed according to either utility-based  or regret-based decision rules.  Chorus, van Cranenburgh, and Dekker  (2014)  provide a comprehensive review of 43 empirical comparisons  between RUM and RRM models that appeared in 21 articles. Their  analysis shows quite clearly the absence of a dominant approach in  terms of model fit because 13 comparisons resulted in a statistical tie,  15 in favor of RUM model and 15 in favor of RRM model.  The RUM model has solid microeconomics foundation that facilitates the derivation of compensation measures, such as the marginal  rate of substitution (MRS), defined as the ratio of two marginal utilities  (  ). If one of the two marginal  utilities is associated with a monetary attribute (typically price), the  marginal rate of substitution is interpreted as the very useful and  popular WTP measure (  ). In the RRM model, the  derivation of the MRS lacks theoretical support of the microeconomics  axiom ( Chorus, 2012 ). However, it is possible to compute the MRS (or  WTP) counterpart for an RRM model, although the derivation is less  straightforward than for a RUM model because of the semi-compensatory nature of the RRM approach. As discussed in  Chorus (2012) , the  RRM counterpart of the MRS is derived as follows:  (7)  Therefore, the MRS (and WTP where  y  refers to the price attribute  and  β  =  –  β ) counterpart for an RRM model is not a single constant  as in the linear RUM model but varies based on the attribute levels in  the chosen and unchosen alternatives in the choice set. In particular,  high (low) values of MRS  are expected when the chosen alternative performs relatively worse (better) than the unchosen alternatives. This argument is an intuitive one and reflects the behavioral  appeal of the RRM semi-compensatory paradigm.  Chorus et al. (2013)  provide a comprehensive comparison of WTP measures derived from  attributes processed under different decision rules, being utility-based,  regret-based, or a combination of the two.  The following section proposes a comparison between RUM and  RRM approaches regarding MNL and MXL models. Willingness to pay  measures derived from the MNL models are further illustrated and  discussed in terms of practical implications. ',\n",
              " \"3. Methods  3.1. Design, sample, and procedures  The study employed a one-factor, lab-coordinated experimental  design on a sample of 279 students, faculty, and staff from a large  Midwestern university who in return for their participation received  Amazon Gift Cards as incentives. Over the course of five weeks, participants were randomly assigned to one of three presentations of an  extended-stay hotel suite that differed in preview interactivity: static  images vs. 360° tour vs. VR. Participants’ age range was 18–69 years old  (M = 23.02). Approximately 33% of participants were male, 75.9%  were Caucasian, and 48.7% earned more than $49,999 annually. When  asked about prior hotel experience, 94.6% reported that they spend  minimum one night a year in hotels and 37.3% have had prior experience with extended-stay hotels. In addition, participants reported  prior experience with computer generated images (79.6%), 360° tours  (76.7%), and VR (35.1%). Those who previously tried VR devices had  experience with Samsung Gear and Sony Playstation VR (see  Appendix  A  and  Appendix B  for detailed demographics).  Upon arrival to the computer lab, participants received an informed  consent explaining the study procedures, risks, benefits, incentives, and  screening questions (i.e., Are you at least 18 years old?; Do you experience migraines, headaches, seizures, or other symptoms triggered  by flashing or flickering lights?; Do you frequently experience motion  sickness (dizziness, light-headedness, and nausea)?; Have you ever experienced cyber sickness (dizziness, light-headedness, and nausea) after  spending time in virtual environments?). Those qualified to participate  in the study read the scenario about “Aevum Hotels” brand which included the description of the hotel company ( Appendix C ) and received  one of the three the manipulation stimuli ( Appendix D ).  In the static images condition, participants saw images of the hotel  suite virtual environment, presented on a laptop screen. A virtual environment of the hotel suite was created using 3D Studio Max architectural modeling software and Unreal video game development engine. Participants in the 360° tour condition reviewed a web-based tour  of the same space with 360° field of view, presented on a laptop screen.  In the VR condition, participants saw the same hotel suite environment  via an HTC Vive headset VR device. The HTC Vive device has a high  field of view screen and is capable of head and motion tracking. Prior to  reviewing the hotel suite, the participants received a brief demonstration of the device controls and navigation through the VR environment  from the researcher. To maintain consistency across the conditions and  minimize the researcher bias, participants in the first two conditions  were instructed how to navigate through static images and 360° tour by  the same researcher. All verbal communication with the participants  followed a scripted dialogue and pertained to the explanation of the  study procedures and navigation through each of the three preview  modes. After providing the explanation, the researcher did not interfere  with the way participants explored the preview. The preview duration  across conditions did not have a significant effect on the levels of brand  experience ( Roy's Largest Root  = 0.021,  F (4,271) = 1.412,  p  = .230).  Following the experimental stimuli, the participants completed a  questionnaire reflecting their evaluations of the constructs of interest,  control variables, and demographic characteristics.  3.2. Measures  The dependent variables were assessed on a 7-point Likert-type/  semantic differential scales, by adapting current instruments for mental  imagery, sense of presence, and brand experience. The list of items with  scale reliabilities is available in  Table 2 . As a manipulation check,  perceived interactivity of the preview was measured by asking the extent to which the preview was interactive (1 = not at all interactive,  7 = extremely interactive), adapted from  Kalyanaraman and Sundar  (2006) .  Towards  the  survey  end  participants  indicated  their  demographic characteristics, prior experiences with hotel stay, VR, and  other technologies, as well as weekly hours spent playing computer,  video, or console games (M = 2.88). Participants reported the scenario  realism as high (1 = highly unrealistic, 7 = highly realistic; M = 5.84;  t  = 25.87,  p  < .001) and found it easy to imagine themselves in the  scenario (1 = very difficult, 7 = very easy; M = 5.83;  t  = 21.95,  p  < .001).  3.3. Data analysis  Because of the multidimensionality of the constructs of interest and  proposed indirect effects, the SEM technique was selected because it  enables concurrent testing of relationships among latent constructs, as  well as more robust estimates of ordinal data. First, SPSS statistical  package was used to conduct descriptive statistics, scale reliabilities,  realism and manipulation checks. Next, a measurement model was  tested using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), followed by the test of  structural model in MPlus using WLSMV estimator, suggested for ordinal data ( Bollen, 1989 ). \",\n",
              " \"3. Methods  3.1. The Delphi method  The Delphi method is a research tool used to systematically structure expert opinions in order to reach agreement on a predetermined  issue or problem ( Okuli & Pawlowski, 2004 ). The Delphi process requires iteration of group conversation until consensus is reached, and is  characterised by a feedback-loop of information exchange where purposely selected participants are given rounds of tasks to complete  ( Linstone & Turoff, 2002 ). It is a staged process where, on completion of  each task, responses are amalgamated, and the combined results are  returned to participants. Each round of tasks provides the participants  with the opportunity to reflect on and reassess their previous contributions until desired objectives are achieved ( Hsu & Sandford, 2007 ).  Relatively small and not overly heterogenic panels are thought to be  able to ‘dig deeper’ into issues explored, because relatively large and  heterogenic panel composition bears a risk of only being able to agree  on trivial and non-relevant points as opinions and perspectives may  diverge too much ( Baker, Lovell, & Harris, 2006 ).  According to  Donohoe and Needham (2009) , the evolution of the  Delphi method is characterised by distinct eras, starting from secrecy  and novelty to popularity and scrutiny, before reaching its current era  of continuity and refinement. Past methodological critiques for the  Delphi approach included the validity, reliability and trustworthiness of  study results ( Woudenberg, 1991 ). For example, high rates of panel  attrition may occur as participants drop out during the course of a study  ( Garrod & Fyall, 2005 ). High attrition rates may seriously call their  quality and significance into question when the reduced panel is biased  in a systematic way ( Garrod, 2012 ). Moreover,  Hasson and Keeney  (2011)  explain that modifications of the Delphi technique to accommodate for different research problems can be associated with discrepancies in design and implementation, associated with high levels of  personal and situation specific bias present in many studies.  However,  recent  guidelines  for  enhancing  Delphi  study  implementation and outcome quality has greatly improved the methodological and conceptual clarity of the research method. Building on the  works of  Day and Bobeva (2005)  who provided a clear taxonomy of  Delphi design variations and a detailed description of key stages in a  Delphi study,  Donohoe and Needham (2009)  critically examined the  technique giving particular attention to its suitability to tourism related  research purposes and its interdisciplinary nature. A Delphi approach to  data collection creates an opportunity to repeatedly engage with multiple stakeholders who are spatially and/or hierarchically dispersed  ( Northcote, Lee, Chock, & Wegner, 2008 ), and given that the tourism  industry is “characterised by fragmentation and limited opportunities  for interaction and knowledge exchange” ( Donohoe & Needham, 2009 ,  p. 420), the Delphi technique particularly appropriate. To explore the  meaning of responsibility-sharing from a protected area management  perspective, an email-based Delphi approach created an opportunity to  engage with a group of protected area managers (experts) spread over  significant geographical distances throughout Australia.  The expert panel composition is fundamental to validity and reliability of Delphi study results ( Donohoe & Needham, 2009 ). Critical  design decisions include a clear definition of expertise, including the  declaration of the expert selection criteria and the sampling method  ( Baker et al., 2006 ). For example, expertise can be defined by one's  knowledge and extent of experience, which is often linked to a professional qualification and the length of involvement with the problem  or issue at hand ( Baker et al., 2006 ), but may also be influenced by a  person's reputation, age, or culture if relevant to a particular research  question ( Day & Bobeva, 2005 ). Further critical panel design decisions  also include careful consideration to maintain a balanced expression of  different study contexts to ensure confidence in the study results  ( Garrod & Fyall, 2005 ).  Garrod (2012)  suggested guidelines to support  reliability and validity of individual Delphi rounds, stressing that is  important to maintain a valid panel of experts considering its size and  composition in the initial as well as the final round of the study.  3.2. Implementing the Delphi method  The quality of the Delphi results is directly linked to the design of  the process ( Okuli & Pawlowski, 2004 ).  Fig. 1  details the stages and  tasks adopted in the current study.  In order to answer the research questions, expertise in this study  was defined by a person's knowledge and experience in relation to  visitor risk management issues in protected areas in Australia. Protected  areas in Australia are governed by both federal and state legislation,  and to populate the expert panel, each state agency responsible for the  management and governance of protected areas (i.e. usually the Parks  and Wildlife Service of each state) as well as the federal body overseeing national parks of specific commonwealth importance (i.e. Parks  Australia) were invited to participate (see  Fig. 2 ). The selection criteria  required Delphi participants to be:  (1) Currently be employed by any Australian protected area management agency for at least 5 years;  (2) Currently be or have been heavily involved in the management of  visitor risk within protected areas and nature reserves as part of  their professional role within this agency; and to  (3) Have a great understanding of the wide variety of natural landscape  forms, the variety of different environmental hazards posing risks to  visitors, and the various ways visitor risks are managed at different  visitor sites within their tenures.  For the current study a panel size of about 20 members was determined as being appropriate, following recommendations of  Baker  et al. (2006)  and  Okuli and Pawlowski (2004) . In order to capture the  various geographical differences and consequently a variety of different  approaches to manage visitor risk in protected areas, each agency was  requested to propose a minimum of two (and a maximum of four) research participants based upon the expertise criteria specified above.  The final Delphi panel consisted of twenty-two ( N  = 22) VRM professionals from seven agencies. The geographical and organisational distribution of the panel is detailed in  Fig. 2 .  For this Delphi process, the criteria specified at the beginning of the  study included that the panel: (1) should comprise at least 50% of the  total panel size, and (2) should comprise at least one participant from  each participating agency. If one of these panel criteria were no longer  met, the study would be terminated (see  Garrod & Fyall, 2005 ;  Donohoe  & Needham, 2009 ;  Garrod, 2012 ).  3.3. Delphi rounds  3.3.1. Round 1: Scoping questions  The first round of the Delphi was explorative in nature (see  Donohoe, 2011 ) and was designed to obtain participants' reflections on  VRM issues and responsibility for safety in protected areas. An email  was sent to participants, asking for response to following questions:  (1) Who do you think is responsible for visitor safety in protected areas,  and why?  (2) Supposing responsibilities are shared between land managers and  visitors, do you think that responsibility-sharing levels of each party  might be different at various areas within your state? Why?  The email reiterated that individual responses would be utilised in a  summarised format to inform subsequent email rounds. Responses to  Round 1 were received from 20 participants (91%), with individual  response length ranging between 111 and 3027 words. Responses to the  questions were uploaded to QSR*NVIVO11 to classify, sort and arrange  data. Using the guidelines proposed by  Brady (2015) , thematic analysis  was employed as the main method to analyse Delphi content.  3.3.2. Round 2 - Task 1: Responsibility for visitor safety  In relation to the first research question, the responses to Round 1  were examined and stakeholder responsibility was identified. The rationale for stakeholder responsibility was also recorded. A summary of  responses was provided to the panel for further refinement. Round 2 Task 1 responses were received from 16 experts (73%). Six agreed to  the information as collated without any changes, and ten panel members agreed with minor wording modifications. Consensus to the first  research question was achieved with results provided in section  4.1  of  this article.  3.3.3. Round 2 - Task 2: Responsibility-sharing across visitation contexts  Round 1 responses were re-examined for the second research  question with the intention of defining how site attributes may influence the responsibility-sharing expectations. Conceptual labels were  attached to individual responses, generally on a phrase or sentence  basis, and categorised. Thirty site attributes were identified that influenced differences in responsibility-sharing in protected areas, which  were grouped into six themes (for a more detailed description of this  process see section  4.2  of this article).  The attribute groups were provided to Delphi panellists for further  evaluation. Here, panel members were asked to reflect on each attribute  based on their importance within responsibility-sharing considerations  and how it would differ across different setting types (i.e. highly  managed, moderately managed, or marginally managed for visitor  risk). Responses to Round 2 - Task 2 were received from 16 panel  members ( 73% ).  3.3.4. Round 3  Responses to Round 2 - Task 2 were analysed applying thematic  coding principles to conceptually understand response patterns ( Brady,  2015 ), also numerically coding attribute importance expressed by panellists. A summary table was created for participants to review in  Delphi Round 3, which included a brief explanation how the themes  were extracted and how it forms part of VRM processes as guided by the  Australian Standard AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management: Principles  and Guidelines  (i.e. defining the risk management context).  Responses to Delphi Round 3 were received from a total of 12 panellists (55%). Of those, 11 approved the themes and suggested minor  alterations of wording to improve clarity. One panellist was reluctant to  comment on Round 3 and noted that he  had expected a more diverse  application that shared responsibility amongst land managers, tour operators, promotors and the visitors themselves.  Further communication with  this participant included a reiteration of the scope of the Delphi study  and a suggestion for further research endeavours.  Whilst the final round is characterised by a decrease in the number  of participants, the panel still met the guidelines specified at the beginning of the study to maintain reliability and validity of results. The  panel comprised at least 50% of members that were initially selected  and included at least one person from every agency. Consensus to the  second research question was achieved with results provided in section  4.3  of this article. \",\n",
              " \"3. Methodology  3.1. A systematic quantitative approach  A systematic quantitative approach is a well-established method  which has recently been well-supported in health science research  ( Pickering & Byrne, 2014 ). This review approach is termed  systematic  because the review process is explicit, reproducible and structured  following a series of clear steps to survey the literature and offers justifications for article inclusion. The approach is  quantitative  because it  quantifies and synthesises the literature patterns in terms of topics,  locations, research methods, and variables, which in turn highlight the  boundary of knowledge regarding the generalisations resulting from the  literature ( Pickering, Grignon, Steven, Guitart, & Byrne, 2015 ). The  research gaps therefore are addressed more efficiently due to the  quantified and well-synthesised trends and patterns ( Pickering & Byrne,  2014 ). Since the conceptualisations of authenticity in the context of  tourism have been considered as diverse and debatable, the quantitative and synthesised features are essential for mapping a more comprehensive landscape of understandings of authenticity in dining experiences.  3.2. Process of the systematic review  The systematic quantitative approach employed in this paper is  adapted from  Pickering and Byrne (2014)  and  Pickering et al. (2015)  to  map, analyse and synthesise the existing literature on authenticity in  dining experiences. A five-step process was employed, which closely  resembles the fifteen-stage process of systematic quantitative literature  review developed by  Pickering and Byrne (2014)  and  Pickering et al.  (2015) . This five-step process has been utilised in recent tourism systematic quantitative review research (e.g.  Khoo-Lattimore, Mura, &  Yung, 2017 ;  Yang et al., 2017 ;  Yung & Khoo-Lattimore, 2017 ), consisting of: (1) defining the research aim and objectives; (2) identifying  searched keywords, databases and establish literature selection criteria;  (3) searching databases, screening searched outcomes against the selection criteria, and refining the inclusion and exclusion criteria; (4)  extracting relevant materials from eligible searched outcomes and  structure a summary table; and (5) synthesising and presenting findings.  Specifically, publications were obtained using a variety of key databases to ensure comprehensiveness of the systematic review. The  literature selection criteria included articles in peer-reviewed academic  journals, written in English, and published as of December 2017. Nonjournal publications (e.g book chapters, conference papers, book reviews, editorial notes and theses) were excluded to ensure a consistent  standard for analysis ( Pickering et al., 2015 ). To capture studies examining authenticity in dining experiences, multiple keywords were  used, in which the term  authenticity  and its related concepts were used  in conjunction with  dining experiences  and its related concepts. In particular, authenticity's related concepts emerged from the theoretical  background section of authenticity, mainly from the tourism context,  including  otherness  and its derivatives  othering  and  othered .  Dining experiences , on the other hand, yielded a number of alternatives including  restaurants, eatery, food establishments, culinary establishments, food experiences, foodservice experiences, culinary experiences,  and  gastronomy  experiences . As a result, 36 (4 × 9) term combinations were searched in  the databases.  The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses) flowchart adapted from  Moher et al. (2010)  was  adopted with some modifications to facilitate the efficiency of the  searching process (see  Fig. 2 ). The 36 keyword combinations were  firstly searched in Google Scholar. Specifically, the combinations containing  authenticity  were searched first, followed by  otherness ,  othering  and  othered . The above procedure was repeated in another seven databases (i.e. Scopus, EBSCO Host, Science Direct, Emerald, Web of  Science, ProQuest and Sage) and constant comparisons across the databases were conducted to avoid duplicates. It was expected that the  number of records identified in the additional seven databases was  decreasing at this stage because most of the records had been found by  Google Scholar. These subsequent seven databases therefore acted as a  reinforcing measure to make certain no records were missed during the  searching process in Google Scholar. As of December 2017, this multiple-comparison process identified 269 records, which were exported  to Endnote software for data management. 28 non-full-text records  excluded in the identification phase consisted of books, book chapters,  conference papers, journal articles and duplicates retrieved from  different online sources. After removing the non-full-text records, the  remaining 241 records were screened against the selection criteria,  where non-journal publications were excluded. The exclusion of nonjournal publications has been a regular occurrence in systematic reviews ( Kim & Cuskelly, 2017 ;  Thomson et al., 2018 ;  Yang et al., 2017 ).  The screening process resulted in 102 eligible full-text records included in the final analysis. After a closer examination of the full texts, a  further 17 records were justifiably discarded. The most common reasons for exclusion were the irrelevant focus concerning authenticity in  dining experiences and authenticity as research implications and suggestions for future research. For instance,  Muniz, Harrington, Ogbeidea,  and Seo (2017)  examines the influence of background sounds and music  on arousal and avoidance behaviours on ethnic menu item selection and  price expectations. Although the ethnic dining setting suggests the existent role of authenticity in this article, its focus is not on how these  examined elements shape perceptions of authenticity, but how they  influence dish selection and price expectation. Another example was by  Vásquez and Chik (2015) , who argue that foodies use online reviews as  a means through which individuals can display their culinary capital to  an audience, as they establish their expertise in certain matters (e.g.  authenticity, taste, quality, and the perceived value of their dining  experiences). Although restaurants’ authenticity is mentioned in this  article, this concept is approached as a mean for online reviewers to  demonstrate their culinary expertise, not to contribute to the overall  dining experience ( Vásquez & Chik, 2015 ), thus this article was also  excluded from the synthesis.  As a result, 85 articles were considered as eligible, and the reference  lists of these articles were cross-checked to identify if there were any  additional records overlooked. The list of 85 selected articles is documented in  Appendix A . These texts were then quantitatively assessed,  categorised and structured so as to offer a comprehensive picture of  authenticity literature in the context of dining experiences. It is acknowledged that the coding and categorisation performed in the review  process were subject to the researchers’ linguistic background and interpretations. As a result, to minimise such effects, the coding and categorisation were conducted and revised after entering the first 10% of  articles ( Pickering & Byrne, 2014 ;  Yang et al., 2017 ). The categories  were then tested and revised for each subsequent 10% of articles entered until the 85 articles were all coded and categorised. Also, to ensure consistency in the coding and categorisation, the categories were  cross-checked among the research team which consists of one Asian and  three native English speaker researchers. Several aspects of each article  were extracted and presented in the synthesis: (1) key academic disciplines interested in authenticity studies and research contexts; (2)  research methods, samplings and approaches; (3) key concepts investigated in the literature in consideration of the presence of theoretical foundations; (4) the relationships reported between authenticity  and  other  concepts;  and  (5)  emerging  dimensions  informing  authenticity in dining experiences. The descriptive findings are presented as tables and figures and discussed throughout the next section,  with the summary of key review findings and the discussion of research  directions in the subsequent section. \"]"

Measures  Scales used in the present study were all adopted from the existing  literature, as we further discuss below. These multi-item scales were  developed based on reflective measures, in that each observed variable  (i.e.,  item)  renders  a  manifestation  of  the  latent  construct  ( Diamantopoulos, Riefler, &amp; Roth, 2008 ). Hence, the construct implied  common causality in its corresponding items.  Human resource practice . We used  Sun et al. (2007)  10-item fourfactor high-performance human resource practice scale to assess the  construct as  “ training, ” “ employment security, ” “ result-oriented appraisal, ”  and  “ participation. ”  The rating scale for each item ranged from  1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). An example of the training  scale item was  “ The organization provides formal training programs to  teach new staff the skills they need to perform their job. ”  An example of  an employment security scale item was  “ The organization provides job  guarantees to employees. ”  An example of a result-oriented appraisal  scale item was  “ Employee performance is more often measured with  objective quantifiable results. ”  An example of a participation scale item  was  “ Employees are allowed to make decisions in their jobs. ”  The scale  is adequately reliable with a Cronbach's alpha ( α ) of 0.90.  Emotional exhaustion . We adopted a four-item scale from  Karatepe  and Uludag (2008)  to assess emotional exhaustion. Each item was assessed using a 9-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9  (strongly agree). Example items were  “ I feel burned out from my work ”  and  “ Working with people all day is really a strain for me. ”  The scale is  highly reliable with an  α  of 0.95.  Intention to quit . We used a four-item scale adopted from  Suazo  (2009) . Each item was evaluated using a 7-point anchor ranging from 1  (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Example items were  “ At work,  I will probably look for a job outside my current organization in the  next year ”  and  “ I often think about quitting my job. ”  The scale is fairly  consistent with an  α  of 0.91.  Brand equity . We used a four-item measure adopted from  Yoo et al.  (2000)  to assess overall brand equity. Each item was evaluated using a  5-point anchor ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree).  An example item was  “ If there is another brand as good as this hotel, I  still prefer this hotel. ”  The scale is adequately reliable with  α  = .87.  Next we aggregated the scale at the organizational level and validated  its appropriateness. First, brand equity was significantly different  among hotels ( F  = 7.85,  p  &lt; .001). Second, inter-member reliability indexes (\n",

We controlled for gender (1 =  “ male ”  and  2 =  “ female ” ), age (1 =  “ 24 or less ”  and 6 =  “ 65 or above ” ), and organization tenure (1 =  “ less than one year ”  and 4 =  “five years or  more) at the individual level. They were included in the analysis as  control variables, as commonly reported in the literature (e.g.,  Hirst,  van Knippenberg, Chen, &amp; Sacramento, 2011 ). We further controlled  for hotel star rating (0 =  “ four star or below ”  and 1 =  “five star or  above ” ) at the organizational level. Our rationale is supported by the  fact that a hotel's brand equity and its impact could be affected by the  hotel strategy, which could be assessed by the property's star rating, as  Sun et al. (2007)  acknowledged.  Data diagnostics . Drawing on recommendations from  Podsakoff,  MacKenzie, Lee, and Podsakoff (2003) , we addressed common method  bias (CMB) based on two approaches. First, data were collected from  two independent sources: employee and customer surveys. Second,  different scale anchors were used to mitigate CMB. We further diagnosed CMB using Harman's single-\n",

We  used a 4-item scale of motivational climate adopted from  Moore,  Brown, and Fry (2015)  to partial out the effects of the predictors on the  criterion variable. The procedure suggests that controlling the marker  variable does not affect the proposed relationships. We diagnosed  multicollinearity using the \n",

Methodology  Let  e  and  s  be arrivals and departures, respectively, to/from airports and ports to/from a certain isolated region on day  t , where transit  passengers are not included. From the arrivals on day  t  it is possible to  assume that a certain proportion    are excursionists and are thereby  leaving the destination on the same day; consequently, the number of  total excursionists can be obtained as   e . Another percentage of  visitors (tourists in this case),   , will return the following day, another    will return two days later and, consequently, it is possible to consider the generic length of stay  j  and its associated percentage as   .  Obviously, it should be verified that  .  In a similar way, if we focus our attention on departures on day  t  denoted by  s , it is possible to assume that these are made up of the set  of excursionists that have arrived on the same day, which, according to  the notation mentioned above can be written as   e  plus the visitors  that arrived one day ago  e  but who are returning today   e  plus  those arriving two days ago  e  and are returning today,   e ; and  all those arriving on previous days and leaving the island on a specific  day. Thus:  (1)  It is important to note that in expression (1), parameters    are  unknown but can be econometrically estimated. In order to facilitate  this estimation it is possible to assume that most tourists stay in the  destination for a period no longer than  m , which could be one month,  two months, …and so on, such that    = 0 for all  j  &gt;  m .  Consequently, it is possible to express the equation to be estimated  as:  (2)  where the random term  u  assumes that the relationship is an approximation. At this point, additional assumptions regarding the temporal  behavior of the parameters are needed in order to undertake the  econometric estimation. A plausible alternative would be allowing  parameters    to change periodically and, for instance, considering  that visitors arriving on a Monday have a different likelihood of being  an excursionist or of leaving the destination with a certain lag compared to visitors arriving on a Saturday. However, since the aim of the  paper is to attempt to replicate data from statistical offices obtained by  surveys, it must be admitted that this kind of information is not frequently offered by official statistics, and only mean values concerning  length of stay are shown. Consequently, if the simplest assumption regarding time-invariant parameters of Equation  (2)  is assumed, the expression to be estimated is:  (3)  At this point, it is important to note that if  s  and  e  are cointegrated,  the  u  term in the regression model (3) has to be stationary, and OLS  estimators of    are consistent. In this sense, and for the daily airport  data from Mallorca,  Haldrup, Hylleberg, Pons, and Sansó (2007)  found  evidence of cointegration between  e  and  s . Additionally, because the  estimated coefficients are interpreted as probabilities, estimation has to  be considered under the restriction of non-negative coefficients.

Article collection  In the initial step, different sets of keywords were used to identify  articles on cognitive biases in tourist decisions. After several attempts,  the two authors agreed upon the set of {tourist, traveler, “decision  making,” cognitive, bias}.  The three journals yielded 269 articles (148, 27, and 94 articles in  JTR, ATR, and TM, respectively). The articles were then collected and  recorded in a spreadsheet to facilitate categorization and prepare for  data screening. Information regarding article titles, authors, year, affiliations, countries, and abstracts was also noted.  3.2. Article screening  All of the 269 articles were screened through two parallel actions: 1)  examining the abstract of each article and 2) inspecting the context  surrounding each of the specified keywords in the body of each article.  This process confirmed whether the article is related to cognitive biases  in tourist decisions. During the screening process, the two researchers  agreed upon the evaluative judgment by assigning each article to one of  the following categories.  Category 1: articles in which at least one cognitive bias type(s) is  explicitly stated within the body.  Category 2: articles that can be inferred as related to cognitive  biases but specify no bias type.  Category 3: articles that are not related to cognitive biases in tourist  decisions.  In this study, only Category 1 was selected for the main analysis.  The 269 articles were reviewed and coded, and the results were jointly  cross-checked to confirm the categorization. The inter-coding reliability  between the two researchers was 85%. Articles that received different  codes, particularly 1 versus 2 and 1 versus 3, were further discussed and  investigated before confirming their categorization. The last step was a  reference search, and a total of 37 articles were selected for the review. </div></span>"

During the earthquake, all scenic spots in  Jiuzhai Valley were damaged to a varying degree, more than 176.5  thousand residents and tourists were affected ( Yang, Xiong, Yu, &amp; Ge,  2018 ) and the destination is still unavailable for visiting ( the  Administration of Jiuzhai Valley, 2019 ). This is the first time in China  that a World Heritage Site was directly hit by a destructive earthquake  ( The Government of Sichuan Province, 2017 ).

So it's imperative to devise  and conduct some effective strategies to promote the tourism recovery  in Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake. This makes Jiuzhai Valley a good  sample for our study.  2.2. A virtual competitive market  In order to develop the simulation model, a virtual competitive  market is built ( Ma, Wen, &amp; Yu, 2015 ). In the market, there are three  competing tourism destinations selected from Sichuan Province, China:  Jiuzhai Valley (JV), Mount Emei (ME), Mount Qingcheng &amp; Dujiangyan  Irrigation System (QD). They are all inscribed as World Heritage Sites  by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, and AAAAA Scenic Areas by the China National Tourism Administration. What's more, these destinations are the top three destinations  that tourists would like to visit in Sichuan ( The Public Opinion \n",

              "  Center of Sichuan Province, 2017 ). So they can be regarded as having  the same level of tourism competitiveness.  These three destinations are all famous for their beautiful natural  scenery and attracting heritages. Sited in the north of Sichuan, JV is  known for multi-level waterfalls, colorful lakes and Tibetan and Qiang  tribes. ME is located in the west of Sichuan and famous for sunrise, sea  of clouds and Buddhist culture and temples. QD is close to Chengdu  City. Actually, QD consists of two sub-destinations: Mount Qingcheng  and the Dujiangyan Irrigation System. Being the birthplace of Taoism,  Mount Qingcheng is known for the pleasant natural environment and  Taoism culture and temples. Dujiangyan irrigation system was built in  the 3rd century B.C. and is still performing its function. They are located closely to each other in Dujiangyan City and are listed together in  the World Heritage List. So in this study, they are regarded as one  destination.  Every year, the three tourism destinations attract millions of tourists.  Table 1  shows the tourist number and market share of the three  destinations. Due to the occurrence of the Wenchuan earthquake and its  catastrophic impacts in 2008, the tourism industry in Sichuan got back  to normal till around 2012, and the recent earthquake hitting JV happened in August 2017. Moreover, it usually takes more than one year or  years for a tourism destination to recovery from a destructive earthquake ( Huang &amp; Min, 2002 ;  Li, Shi, &amp; Deng, 2013 ). So the data of  tourists and market share used in this study is from 2012 to 2016 on an  annual scale, and therefore, the as date for the following tables ( Tables  2–5 ) is December 31, 2016.  2.3. Destination selection model  Theory of planned behavior (TPB) is chosen as the conceptual basis  of the model in this study. Agent-based modelling begins with the development of a conceptual framework ( Richetin et al., 2010 ). However,  most conceptual frameworks were not built on well-established psychological models of behaviors, which would make these researches in  lack of theoretical foundation and restrict the models' ability of representing the reality ( Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Sun, 2006 ). This  henomenon also exists in the tourism study with ABM (for example,  Johnson &amp; Sieber, 2011 ;  Balbi et al., 2013 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ). TPB  is proved applicable in empirical tourism destination selection researches ( Jalilvand &amp; Samiei, 2012 ;  Lam &amp; Hsu, 2004 ;  Quintal, Lee, &amp;  Soutar, 2010 ), and useful in predicting behavior in ABM ( Ceschi,  Dorofeeva, Sartori, Dickert, &amp; Scalco, 2015 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). The essence of tourist recovery is encouraging tourists to choose the affected destination as a tourism destination ( Mair  et al., 2014 ). This makes TPB suitable for the basis of our study's destination selection model.  TPB was developed by Ajzen based on the theory of reasoned action  ( Ajzen, 1991 ): the individual's intention is a central factor to perform a  given behavior. The stronger the intention is, the more likely the performance of the behavior will happen. There are three psychological  determinants of intention, attitude toward the behavior, subjective  norm and perceived behavioral control. The greater the attitude toward  the behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control is, the  stronger an individual's attention to perform the behavior will be.  Some online data indicators or indicators based on online data are  used to measure the three psychological determinants ( Fig. 2 ). Although there are already literature coupling TPB and ABM, most of  them used questionnaires or face-to-face interviews to measure the  psychological  determinants  (for  example,  Richetin  et  al.,  2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). These self-reported data may amplify the inconsistency between intention and behavior, and constraint the predicting  ability of TPB because the individuals' psychological status changes  overtime and some other important explanatory factors are neglected  ( Lee, Mjelde, Kim, &amp; Lee, 2014 ). Online data have been widely used to  measure the psychological status and proved effective ( Armando, José,  Gildardo, &amp; Barker, 2017 ;  Lin, Margolin, &amp; Wen, 2017 ). So we selected  these public online indicators to measure attitude toward the behavior,  subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. In the market, all  tourists will choose one of the three destinations to visit according to  their evaluations based on this model (it’s worth noting that the  planned behavior of tourists relying on off-line sources are not represented in the model).  2.3.1. Attitude toward the behavior  Attitude toward the behavior (AT) refers to the product of an individual's outcome evaluation of a certain behavior and the belief to  perform that behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Lam &amp; Hsu, 2006 ). In tourism  activity, tourists' outcome evaluation mainly lies in the enjoyment that  comes from natural and cultural scenic sightseeing ( Leisen, 2001 ;  Zhang &amp; Hui, 2016 ). The quantity and quality of scenic spots are key  factors affecting the enjoyment ( Meng, Ming, Liu, &amp; Zhu, 2002 ;  Sun,  2006 ). Because the three destinations in this study all have attractive  but unique natural and cultural scenic spots, making it hard to measure  and compare their quality, so we use scenic spot quantity (SQ) to  measure the outcome of visiting behavior (see  Table 2 ).  \n",

              " has become the first approach to get information  about a destination when tourists plan a trip ( Jansen, Ciamacca, &amp;  Spink, 2008 ;  Xiang &amp; Gretzel, 2010 ). The stronger tourists' belief to visit  a destination is, the more information they will search for it ( Xiang &amp;  Gretzel, 2010 ;  Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Cui, 2018 ). So in this study the search  index data (SD) of the three destinations (see  Table 2 ), from Baidu, the  largest search engine company in China ( Yang, Pan, Evans, &amp; Lv, 2015 ),  is used to measure the belief of the tourists. These search index data’s  unit is the online search frequency with the destination’s name, “travel  to the destination” and “tourism in the destination” as key words. For  example, for Jiuzhai Valley, the key words are “ 九寨沟 ” (Jiuzhai  Valley), “ 九寨沟旅行 ” (travel to Jiuzhai Valley) and “ 九寨沟旅游 ”  (tourism in Jiuzhai Valley).  The relation between SQ and SD is expressed as equation  (1)  with a  random sensitivity coefficient b . Because the tourists' are heterogeneous and different tourists' may have different sensitivity to the  indicators ( Mckercher, 1999 ;  Russell &amp; Faulkner, 1999 ), so b  is  randomly assigned from 0 to 1 to every agent in the model ( Richetin  et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ). “0” stands for “not sensitive at all”, “1”  stands for “highly sensitive”. In the following, b , b , b  and b  have the  same function with b .  (1)  2.3.2. Subjective norm  Subjective norm (SN) means the influence of others' opinions on the  behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Lee, Han, &amp; Lockyer, 2012 ). Online review is the  major source of these opinions when tourists choose a tourism  destination ( Fang, Ye, Kucukusta, &amp; Law, 2016 ;  Andrei, Svetlana, &amp;  Juan, 2019 ). Previous studies have proved that online review can significantly affect tourists' subjective norms ( Jalilvand &amp; Samiei, 2012 ;  Bynum, Evan, Carol, &amp; Whitney, 2018 ). So in this study, online review  (RE) of the three destinations is used to measure the subjective norm. In  the development of conceptual framework and the simulation process  in ABM, the conclusions and data from empirical studies are useable  ( Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Ceschi et al., 2015 ).  Lai, Tang, and Zhu (2011)  collected the arrival data and online reviews of some destinations in  China, and found that the quantity and quality of online review could  affect the tourist arrivals. So, the relation between online review and  subjective norm is expressed in equations  (2) and (3) . b  is a random  sensitivity coefficient, T  is the number of each destination's total  online reviews, and N  is the number of each destination's negative  online reviews ( Lai et al., 2011 ). The constant coefficients (0.018 and  −2.73) are from the findings of  Lai et al. (2011) . The original data of  online review of the three destinations is from  Ctrip.com , the largest  travel website in China ( Table 3 ).  It's worth noting that the value of these constant coefficients (including the constant coefficients in the following equation  (5)  and  equation  (7) ) need to be adjusted according to the verification and  validation. Although the verification and validation in our study shows  that there is no need of adjustment.  (2)  (3)  2.3.3. Perceived behavioral control  Perceived behavioral control (BC) reflects the individuals' evaluation of the ease or difficulty to perform a certain behavior ( Ajzen, 1991 ;  Ceschi et al., 2015 ), which can be affected by traffic, economic and  psychological factors in tourism activity ( Lee et al., 2012 ;  Sergey &amp;  David, 2016 ). In this study, the sum of traffic accessibility (TA), payment capacity (PC) and security level (SL) is used to measure perceived  behavioral control, which is expressed in equation  (4) . b , b  and b  are  sensitivity coefficients.  (4)  Traffic accessibility (TA) reflects tourists' perceived control on the  ease or difficulty to get to a destination ( Zhang, Zhang, &amp; Lu, 2010 ).  Higher traffic accessibility can increase the tourists' visit intention  ( Geoffrey, Giacomo, &amp; Richard, 2019 ). In this study, according to Hao,  Wang and Jin (2012) , traffic accessibility is calculated by the shifts of  trains, buses and planes to the three destinations. In equation  (5) , m is  the weight of every traffic mode and n is the daily average number of  shifts (here, buses are the ones directly go to the destinations). Usually,  tourists will choose a central city as a transfer station ( Dredge, 1999 )  before visiting a specific tourism destination. So in this study, Chengdu  is pointed as the transfer station. The original data of traffic accessibility is from  Ctrip.com  and official website of the three tourism destinations ( Table 4 ).  (5)  Payment capacity (PC) (comprised of income and cost) reflects  tourists' perceived control on the affordability to visit a destination ( Lee  et al., 2012 ;  Liu, Tong, &amp; Ding, 2017 ;  Geoffrey et al., 2019 ). Income and  cost are economic factors influencing tourists' behavior ( Sparks, 2007 ;  Sparks &amp; Pan, 2009 ). Other things being equal, higher income can increase the intention to visit a destination ( Lee et al., 2012 ) and higher  cost can decrease the intention ( Geoffrey et al., 2019 ). Here in equation  (6) , payment capacity is used to represent the effect of income and cost  ( Liu et al., 2017 ). Income means per capita disposable income, and  Hcost, T1cost and T2cost mean the average daily accommodation cost,  ticket cost and transportation cost. The initial value of per capita  disposable income is 16510 RMB, from the China State Statistics Bureau's report released in 2012. In  Table 5 , accommodation cost is the  average price of the hotels near the destinations from  Ctrip.com , ticket  cost is from the official websites of destinations; traffic cost is calculated  from the distance from Chengdu to the destinations based on the conclusions of  Zhang, Wu, Cao, and Wu (2015) . β is an alteration coefficient to simulate the variation of payment capacity ( Liu et al., 2017 ). It  is the result of per capita disposable income growth rate plus 1 every  year (INCOME) divided by tourism consumer index per year (TCPI).  From  Table 6 , the value of β is randomly assigned from 1.03 to 1.09 in  the simulation.  (6)  Security level (SL) reflects tourists' perceived control on visiting a  destination safely ( Geoffrey et al., 2019 ;  Quintal et al., 2010 ;  Sergey &amp;  David, 2016 ). In this study, when there is no earthquake, all destinations' security level is 1.  Wang and Jia (2014)  investigated the risk  perception dynamics by utilizing online search information after three  destructive earthquakes in China. Because these three earthquakes and  the earthquake in our study all happened in Sichuan Province. So based  on their results, the security level equals (1-0.4e ) when an earthquake happens ( Wang &amp; Jia, 2014 ). 0.4e stands for risk level, e is  the natural constant, and t is the time value.  (7)  2.3.4. Visit intention and behavior  In reality, tourists have different dependence on the attitude toward  the behavior, subjective norm and perceived behavior control ( Ceschi  et al., 2015 ;  Liu et al., 2017 ). To simulate this, three weight coefficients  (W , W  and W , W +W +W  = 1) are introduced. What's more, to  simulate the heterogeneity of tourists to the utmost extent, the value is  randomly assigned to them from 0 to 1 ( Liu et al., 2017 ;  Papadopoulos,  Baez, Alt, &amp; Darken, 2013 ). Then the sum of the three psychological  determinants provides a behavioral intention score for tourists ( Liu  et al., 2017 ;  Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ). So, the visit intention (VI) of  tourists can be expressed as equation  (8) .  (8)  (9)  Before the actual visit behavior (VB), tourists will evaluate the three  destinations according to equation  (8) . If completely rational, tourists  will visit the destination with the highest value of VI as equation  (9)  ( Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ). Whereas in reality,  individuals usually have some inconsistency between intention and  behavior according to TPB, which is call intention-behavior gap  ( Echegaray &amp; Hansstein, 2016 ;  Hsu &amp; Huang, 2010 ;  Lee et al., 2014 ).  This gap may vary according to the researches' data source, model  completeness and research method ( Lee et al., 2014 ;  Willekens, 2017 ).  To simulate the gap, methods like  ε -greedy method, softmax method  and trembling hand method are introduced in ABM and proved effective ( Papadopoulos et al., 2013 ;  Richetin et al., 2010 ;  Willekens, 2017 ).  All these methods hold the view that, the higher the intention is, the  more likely the individual will do the corresponding behavior, but there  is still probability that behavior with smaller intention will be  erformed.  Richetin et al. (2010)  have successfully simulated the intention-behavior gap in TPB, and proved that a 5% inconsistency rate  will have the optimal outcome. So similarly, in our study, we firstly set  the inconsistency rate as 5%. This means, tourists have 95% probability  to visit the destination with the highest VI and have 5% probability to  randomly visit the other two destinations. The inconsistency rate will  be adjusted according to the following validation and verification results.  2.4. Simulation \n",

              " initialization  2.4.1. Tourist input  Tourists are represented with agents in the model. An agent stands  for a group of tourists with similar behaviors ( Balbi et al., 2013 ). By  assigning different values of sensitivity and weight to different agents,  the heterogeneity of tourist can be simulated. Usually, the less agents  are in the model, the more fluent and quick the model runs. So, in this  study, an agent stands for 10 thousand tourists due to the calculation  ability limitation of our computer. The initial number of agents is 1153,  which is corresponding to the total tourists of JV, ME and QD in 2012.  The market growth is also taken into consideration. As showed in  Table 7 , during 2012–2016, the average market growth rate is 9.2%. So  in the simulation, since 2013, every time the model runs, the total  agents increase at the rate of 9.2% till the number of tourists exceeds  the market capacity of JV, ME or QD ( Table 8 ).  2.4.2. Normalization  Due to the difference of the data's units and scales, the original data  should be normalized into the same scale before simulation ( Chen &amp;  Xue, 2007 ;  Kövecses &amp; Ebrahimi, 2009 ). Here, because of the existence  of sensitivity coefficients, weight coefficients, and the comparison  among the three destinations, the original data is normalized into the  range of [0, 1] by minimization: x ’ = x /X  ( Guo, 1998 ). For example, the original data of the three destinations' attitude towards the  behavior (AD = SQ*SD) is 68880(JV), 19150(ME) and 12180 (QD),  after normalization, it becomes 1, 0.278 and 0.177. The results of  normalization are in  Table 9 .  2.5. Description of RecoverySim1.0  RecoverySim1.0 is developed to simulate the tourist recovery of  Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake. It is created on NetLogo, a powerful  and widely used platform for ABM ( Ma, Weng, &amp; Yu, 2015 ). Because  NetLogo is “particularly well suited for modelling complex systems  developing over time” and “makes it possible to explore the connection  between the micro-level behavior of individuals and the macro-level  patterns that emerge from their interaction” ( Wilensky, 1999 ).  In RecoverySim1.0, the simulation process consists of five major  steps: (1) Agents of tourists are produced in an annual scale; (2) The  agents enter the estimation procedure to evaluate their visit intention of  the three tourism destinations one by one; (3) The judgment program  will send an agent to the destination with the highest visit intention in a  95% probability or send it to the other two destinations in a 5%  probability; (4) The number of tourists and market share of the three  destinations will be shown in the interface; (5) The data will be reset  and the simulation procedures will be repeated until the number of  tourists exceeds the tourist capacity of the destinations.  The operational interface of RecoverySim1.0 consists of one “setup”  button, one “go” button, two choosers of scenarios, six monitors of  market share and tourist number, and two plots of market share and  tourist number ( Fig. 3 ). To operate the simulation: (1) Click “EarthquakeSetting” chooser and “StrategySetting” chooser to create a scenario; (2) Click “setup” button to set the values of parameters; (3) Click  “go” button to trigger the simulation process; (4) The monitors and  plots will show the simulation results.  2.6. Verification and validation  During the development of the simulation model, several problems  or errors may arise ( Johnson &amp; Sieber, 2011 ). Therefore it's necessary to  check to what extent the model functions as expected and reflects the  reality with some evaluations ( Johnson &amp; Sieber, 2011 ;  Pizzitutti et al.,  2014 ). Usually there are two kinds of evaluations: verification and  validation.  Verification means ensuring building the model right, which involves the comparison of the conceptual model and the simulated one,  and evaluation of the internal consistency ( Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ;  Sargent, 2003 ). The methods for verification involve program debugging, checks of intermediate simulation output and conceptual structure test ( Kong &amp; Wang, 2017 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ;  Sargent, 2003 ). To  verify RecoverySim1.0, we used the following methods: first, the codes  were debugged by the self-test function in NetLogo, and reviewed by  ABM experts, during which no errors were found; then, we use “turtle  monitor” tool in NetLogo to check the visit intention of the agents and  make sure not 100% but around 95% agents visit destinations with the  highest visit intention; at last, for conceptual structure test, the values  of influence factors were adjusted to different levels to check if the  output varied in the same direction. For example, when the value of  JV's security decreased from 1 to 0.5, its market share dropped from  around 32% to about 24%. The results of these kind of tests showed that  the simulation model functioned as the conceptual model.  Validation means ensuring building the right model, which requires  to check whether the simulation represents the reality ( Sargent, 2003 ).  The widely used methods for validation is checking the difference of the  simulated data to the empirical data and comparing the simulated and  the empirical data in a graph ( Balbi et al., 2013 ;  Johnson &amp; Sieber,  2011 ;  Pizzitutti et al., 2014 ). To validate RecoverySim1.0: first, the  difference of the simulated to the empirical data is checked; second, the  simulated and the empirical data is compared in a graph. The simulation process (and the following simulations in the Result section) is  repeated ten times and the results are averaged to account for the  randomness in the simulation ( Johnson &amp; Sieber, 2011 ).  In the difference checking progress, in order to find out the proper  inconsistency rate, we set three scenarios: 0% inconsistency rate, 5%  inconsistency rate and 10% inconsistency rate. The difference of the  simulated and the empirical market share is listed in  Table 10 . It's obvious that, with the \n",

              " of the difference and the range  of the difference all being the smallest (1.14% and −2.10%–2.00%),  5% inconsistency rate makes the optimal simulation results.  What's more, in  Fig. 4 , it shows that the simulation data with a 5%  inconsistency rate well fits the empirical data, which means the simulation result well represents the reality. So RecoverySim1.0 with a 5%  inconsistency rate can be used to simulate the tourist recovery of  Jiuzhai Valley after the earthquake according to the verification and  validation. </div></span>"

Data collection  This research studies online reviews on TripAdvisor, which is the  most well-known review platform in the tourism sector and is employed  by millions of users ( Baka, 2016 ;  Simeon et al., 2017 ). The scope of this  study is the attractions in Phuket. To select the attractions, the authors  explored travel websites that published posts about Phuket, such as  Phuket.com's  “ 15 Best Things to Do in Phuket ” , TripAdvisor's  “ Things to  Do in Phuket ” , Expedia's  “ Things to Do in Phuket 2019 ” , and Phuket101.net's  “ 18 Best Things to Do in Phuket ” . Several types of attractions were identified, including beaches, islands, Buddhist temples,  markets, a pedestrian street, shopping malls, entertainment events, and  animal sanctuaries and zoos. Large shopping malls, entertainment  events, and animal zoos and sanctuaries were excluded from the study  because they were operated mainly by the private sector; other types of  attractions were selected. The authors explored the information about  attractions in Phuket on those websites and identified 20 beaches  (25,458 reviews in total), 12 island locations (12,584 reviews), 12  markets (3,514 reviews), 2 Buddhist temples (10,519 reviews), and a  edestrian street (13,004 reviews) based on their popularity ( Table 2 ).  Reviews in English were collected in February 2019. In total, 65,079  online reviews were initially included in this research. The five categories of attractions were analysed separately.  3.2. Data pre-processing  All textual reviews contain a title and a body. To comprehensively  analyse all textual content, the authors combined the title of each review with the body. The data were pre-processed and analysed using  KNIME Analytics Platform 3.7.1. KNIME is a free open-source data  analytics platform that uses a modular pipelining concept.

Data pre-processing begins with a punctuation eraser to remove punctuation from reviews, followed by a case converter, which changes all text to lowercase. Then, several filters are applied: first, the number filter removes  all numbers from the reviews. Second, the N Chars filter removes  reviews with less than a specific number of characters; it was set at  three in this research. Finally, the stop word filter is applied to remove  insignificant words. This study used the initial list of common English  stop words by XPO6 and included other insignificant words as well as  proper nouns such as  “ Phuket ” ,  “ Patong ” , and  “ Karon ” . In total, 65,042  reviews remained for further analysis. Next, all words were stemmed  (e.g.,  “ swims ”  and  “ swimming ”  were converted to  “ swim ” ) using an  algorithm by  Porter (1980) .  3.3. Data analysis: \n",

The number of reviews in each dimension was counted.  The proportion of a dimension's number of reviews to the attractions'  total number of reviews is regarded as the salience of that dimension,  which is used in a subsequent analysis.  To determine the valence of the reviews, this study used the description from the o ffi cial TripAdvisor website, which states that 5  points is excellent, whereas 3 points is average. The authors grouped 4and 5-point reviews as positive and 3-point reviews and below as negative. This categorisation scheme was previously created in a study by  Taecharungroj (2019) .  To assess the valence of each dimension, a cross-tabulation analysis  between the valence and the dimension of the reviews was conducted.  The cross-tabulation analysis showed the expected numbers and the  observed numbers of positive and negative reviews of each dimension.  The valence of the dimensions is the difference between the observed  and expected numbers divided by the total number of reviews in that  dimension.  Finally, a chart of each type of attraction was created to illustrate  the salience and the valence of the dimensions. The charts are called the  dimensional salience-valence analysis (DSVA).  3.4.

It is a  popular algorithm for document classification:  “ the algorithm computes  the posterior probability that the document belongs to different classes  and assigns it to the class with the highest posterior probability ”  ( Tan &amp;  Zhang, 2008 ). In short, it computes the probability that a particular  review is positive or negative based on its combination of terms. In  addition to its prediction, the naïve Bayes algorithm in KNIME Analytics is valuable in indicating the average number of times a term is  present in a positive or negative review. These data are the building  blocks of the valence analysis of terms in the current research. To  conduct the naïve Bayes algorithm and analyse the terms, the authors  followed these steps:  1.

The valence of the terms was computed by the following  formula:  where POS is the average number of times the term is present in a  positive review, and NEG is the average number of times the term is  present in a negative review. Based on this formula, the valence of the  term in the current study refers to the difference between the average  number of times the term is present in positive and negative reviews  divided by the sum of the average number of times the term is present  in positive and negative reviews. The more positive the valence, the  more the term is present in positive reviews. In contrast, a high negative  valence means that the term is more frequently found in negative reviews.  To compare the valence and salience of terms, the lexical saliencevalence analysis (LSVA) bubble charts were drawn. The salience of the  term is computed by the logarithm to base 10 function of the frequency  of each term. Due to the left skewness of the distribution of term frequencies, the logarithm function provides clarity in the charts by reducing the outlying terms. The sizes of the bubbles are the standardised  weight of each term in its corresponding dimension. A larger bubble  means the term is more relevant to that dimension. </div></span>"

The interviews revealed that the reasons for preferring a specific  type of swimsuit included complying with general social/cultural  norms and trying to have or avoid extensive tanning. One's relative  satisfaction with body image may turn one's burkini into a “hiding suit”  that protects one's self-esteem from looking unhealthy on the beach. In  contrast, bikinis enable females to compete to be the one with the most  attractive body.  4.1.1. Intolerance to differences in appearance  Negative reactions to different swimsuits emerged from the interviews not only for out-groups (i.e. unknown customers) but also for ingroups (e.g. companions). A nineteen-year-old female indicated that  her friends prefer to wear bikinis, though she does not. She thinks that  the “burkini gives her personal assurance and a feeling of safety.” For  unknown customers, interviews consistently demonstrated that differences in swimsuits may cause stress and discomfort.  “It was uncomfortable to see everyone in their bikinis when I am the  only one wearing a burkini. I felt like a black sheep … I stayed at the  corner of the pool for 15 minutes and then left.” (24 years, burkini  wearer)  The qualitative interviews revealed that negative glances are received from others who wear different swimsuits, due to jealousy.  “I prefer bikini but sometimes … other females who wear a burkini  may stare at me, especially if they are sitting beside their husbands,  making me totally uncomfortable … So I may decide not to swim, go  to a different beach or wait till everyone else has gone” (23 years,  bikini wearer)  Similarity in swimsuits seems to be an important issue in determining beach/resort preferences. Other respondents seem tolerant of  other customers who dress differently, but this was confined to the  authenticity and attractiveness of their burkinis.  “I am okay with the burkini, but I am not okay with those who swim  in their own clothes. There are many fashionable good-looking  burkinis!” (21 years, bikini wearer)  “I dislike girls who wear swimsuits that look like burkinis” (22  years, bikini wearer).  Attractive appearance is an important aspect of indirect customerto-customer interaction ( Brocato et al., 2012 ), even when this acknowledges a difference. Similar incidents were reported by the press in  Dubai when tourists became angry because of a female who was  wearing a non-traditional burkini (i.e. one that did not fit the body)  ( Young, 2017 ).  4.1.2. Tolerance of the elderly  Most of the interviewees were consistent in claiming that they do  not have a problem with elderly unknown people.  “My mother and grandmother are my friends. So I can relate to other  ladies of their age. I can happily engage in a conversation with  strangers, regardless of their age” (23 years, burkini wearer).  The greater tolerance of one's elders seems to be an integral part of  the collectivistic nature of the Egyptian \n",

This contrasts with the findings of prior studies that young  customers always feel intolerant in the presence of the elderly (e.g.  Thakor et al., 2008 ).  4.1.3. Other aspects of similarity  The interviews revealed that perceptions of similarity to unknown  others on the beach may also extend beyond age and the type of  swimsuit and incorporate other visible aspects, such as piercing as well  as non-visible aspects (e.g. personality), which may act as social clues to  determine whether they are compatible.  “On the beach, I talk to others who  look  and  talk  like me … it is a  personality thing … piercing may stop me from interacting with  someone I don't know because I hate it” (22 years, bikini wearer).  4.2.

In this endeavour, causal research has been underused (e.g.  Choi &amp; Mattila,  2016 ;  Levy, 2010 ). In the present paper, a scenario-based experimental  design along with sketches was used to enable confounding factors to be  controlled ( Choi &amp; Mattila, 2016 ). A factorial between-subject experimental design was adapted, involving 2 (burkini-wearing versus bikiniwearing respondents) x 2 (old versus young other unknown customers)  x 2 (similar versus different appearance of other unknown customers).  Consistent with prior research (e.g.  Johnson &amp; Grier, 2013 ), the focus  was on extreme points on the continuum of heterogeneity (i.e. those  who preferred burkini and bikini swimsuits), resulting in eight experimental conditions in total (see  Table 1 ). Similarity in appearance was  operationalised by comparing the respondent's preferred type of  swimsuit with those featured in a given sketch (see  Appendix no. 1 ). For  instance, if the respondents' preference (e.g. a tankini) was different  from those featured in the sketch (e.g. a bikini), they were discarded.  4.2.1. Setup  Consistent with previous research ( Yan et al., 2011 ), four sketches,  featuring a group of six women wearing swimsuits, were developed by a  professional artist.

Although the region is not designated  as a national park, the mosaic of lakes and forests, together with the traditional rural landscape, have been attracting tourists for many years. In  the past few years the number of tourists has increased significantly – by  35% between 2010 and 2015 ( Derek, Woźniak, &amp; Kulczyk, 2017 ) and,  therefore, management of the area must take into account both environmental threats and the interests of various groups of tourists.  This study develops a typology of tourists visiting the Great Masurian  Lakes as a function of the activities they undertake. In a second step, we  identify differences between these types in terms of travel patterns and  spatial behaviours, and the economic value given to nature. This is  achieved using a cluster analysis based on \n",

Methodology  3.1. Study site  The Great Masurian Lakes region is located in north-east Poland and  covers 2811 km . The area consists of 10 municipalities, including seven  small and medium-sized towns ( Fig. 1 ). With its numerous lakes, forests,  fields and meadows, it is widely perceived as a nature-based destination. A  broad range of outdoor activities that are more-or-less active, and landand water-based can be undertaken, almost exclusively in summer. The  area is particularly interesting for sailors as it is the only place in Poland  (and one of only a few in Europe) with such a long inshore sailing area: the  primary route is 110 km long, with numerous secondary waterways. This  means that sailors can travel for many days, mooring in marinas or offshore (using their yachts as accommodation).  3.2. Data collection  We carried out an on-site \n",

Specifically, it was undertaken in front of convenience stores or small  supermarkets (if there were any) as we assumed that every tourist (from  sailors to leisure tourists) has to purchase food and drink from time to  time. We deliberately chose not to collect data in tourist centres, tourist  accommodation facilities, marinas, or any other tourist establishments,  in order to avoid any particular activity having an undue influence. For  example, more sailors or others interested in water-based activities  would be found in marinas or near the shores of a lake, while more  leisure tourists would be found in hotels, etc. The aim was to obtain a  sample that was as reliable as possible in terms of the representativeness of the activities undertaken by tourists.

Fstatistics indicated which factors best differentiated segments, while pvalues indicated the level of significance.  In order to define and name clusters we calculated the mean for  every activity within each cluster and compared this to the mean for the  whole sample. This captured the key characteristics of each cluster and  made it possible to name it as a function of the activities that were  undertaken most frequently by its members.  3.3.2. Demographic analyses  Regarding demographic characteristics, comparisons between clusters included: gender, age, educational level, place of residence, length  of stay, visitor type, number of people in the group, and respondents  travelling with children.  3.3.3. Individual Travel Cost Method  The Individual Travel Cost Method measured the economic value  that each cluster placed on nature. In this method, the value of a given  good is estimated based on how much people pay (or are willing to pay)  to  access  and  ‘use’  it  ( Czajkowski,  Giergiczny,  Kronenberg,  &amp;  Tryjanowski, 2014 ). Assessing the monetary value of non-market goods  is a helpful management tool, as it makes it possible to compare various  types of goods and use scenarios. It is also an important marketing tool,  because monetary value is easy to understand for non-specialists and  therefore helps to make the vague notion of the value of nature real.  Our analysis included the following elements (see  Kulczyk, Derek, &amp;  Woźniak, 2016  for more details):  − The cost of the journey: calculated as the sum of the cost of travel  distance (distance travelled from the place of residence to the destination multiplied by the price of fuel) and cost of travel time  (journey time multiplied by the cost of journey time, described as a  percentage of the mean wage in Poland). Travel distances and times  were calculated using Google Maps based on data provided by  surveyed individuals;  − Accommodation cost: the mean price of accommodation per activity  type multiplied by the respondent's length of stay. In the case of  sailors who used their yacht as accommodation, marina fees were  used;  − Use cost. The cost of activities undertaken by tourists estimated on  the basis of the cost of equipment rental.  All of the above costs were calculated in Polish zloty, recalculated  into euros and summed to obtain individual, per tourist, travel costs.  Next, means were calculated for each cluster.  3.3.4. \n",

The confidence envelope, which determines statistical significance,  was established using nine permutations to obtain a graph that  shows the expected, random pattern and the observed pattern. The  dataset is spatially clustered if the curve of the observed pattern is  above the expected one, otherwise it indicates dispersion ( Fig. 2 ).  The Standard Deviational Ellipse method was applied to identify the  location of accommodation where tourists stayed. The latter two methods  aim to indicate the spatial pattern of tourists constituting each cluster.  3.3.3. Individual Travel Cost Method  The Individual Travel Cost Method measured the economic value  that each cluster placed on nature. In this method, the value of a given  good is estimated based on how much people pay (or are willing to pay)  to  access  and  ‘use’  it  ( Czajkowski,  Giergiczny,  Kronenberg,  &amp;  Tryjanowski, 2014 ). Assessing the monetary value of non-market goods  is a helpful management tool, as it makes it possible to compare various  types of goods and use scenarios. It is also an important marketing tool,  because monetary value is easy to understand for non-specialists and  therefore helps to make the vague notion of the value of nature real.  Our analysis included the following elements (see  Kulczyk, Derek, &amp;  Woźniak, 2016  for more details):  − The cost of the journey: calculated as the sum of the cost of travel  distance (distance travelled from the place of residence to the destination multiplied by the price of fuel) and cost of travel time  (journey time multiplied by the cost of journey time, described as a  percentage of the mean wage in Poland). Travel distances and times  were calculated using Google Maps based on data provided by  surveyed individuals;  − Accommodation cost: the mean price of accommodation per activity  type multiplied by the respondent's length of stay. In the case of  sailors who used their yacht as accommodation, marina fees were  used;  − Use cost. The cost of activities undertaken by tourists estimated on  the basis of the cost of equipment rental.  All of the above costs were calculated in Polish zloty, recalculated  into euros and summed to obtain individual, per tourist, travel costs.  Next, means were calculated for each cluster.  3.3.4. \n",

Clusters were evaluated by analysing their geographic distribution  and spatial patterns. The same procedure was used regarding the supply  of accommodation facilities. The following measures were used:  − Directional Distribution (Standard Deviational Ellipse) ( Chew, 1966 ;  Mitchell, 2005 ;  Wang, Wenzhong, &amp; Zelang, 2015 ) summarizes the  geographic distribution of features: central tendency, dispersion,  and directional trends (rotation). The  x  and  y  axes of an ellipse are  calculated separately as a standard distance in the  x  and  y  direction  from the mean centre which is the average  x  and  y  coordinate of all  the features in the study area. The measure was used, for example,  in monitoring urban activity using mobile phone–based sensor data  ( Ahas et al., 2015 ), or in analysing the dispersion of historic  monuments ( Jażdżewska, 2018 ).  − Average Nearest Neighbour ( Ebdon, 1985 ;  Mitchell, 2005 ) is used in  order to measure the degree of spatial \n",

The confidence envelope, which determines statistical significance,  was established using nine permutations to obtain a graph that  shows the expected, random pattern and the observed pattern. The  dataset is spatially clustered if the curve of the observed pattern is  above the expected one, otherwise it indicates dispersion ( Fig. 2 ).  The Standard Deviational Ellipse method was applied to identify the  location of accommodation where tourists stayed. The latter two methods  aim to indicate the spatial pattern of tourists constituting each cluster.  4.4.2. Individual Travel Cost Method  The two clusters that value nature the most are  sailors , especially  angling sailors , whose per-person travel costs are estimated at an average of  325 euros. This is because the cost of renting a yacht is very high (use cost)  and angling sailors stay for the longest time among all clusters (see section  4.4.1 ). On the other hand, sailors rarely pay for accommodation, as they  often sleep on their yachts that are moored offshore.  Clusters that spend the least money are  water recreationists  (107  euros) and  passive tourists  (114 euros). This may be explained by the fact  that neither cluster participates in a specialized activity, and the activities they do undertake the most often (walking, sunbathing, or even  bathing in a lake or a river) can be done almost anywhere. They also do  not spend money on facilities (use costs are estimated at 8 euros in both  cases).  Travel costs clearly divide clusters into two groups:  sailors , whose  travel costs are derived from use costs (renting yachts) and others  whose costs are mainly associated with accommodation. Journey costs  are least diverse among clusters (the maximum is around 20%).  Anglers ,  angling sailors  and  sailors  have the highest costs, as they travel the  longest distances to their destination ( Fig. 7 ) (see  Table B  and  Table C  in  the Appendix for detailed data).  4.4.3. Spatial behaviours  Fig. 8  shows the spatial distribution of each cluster. The percentage  of cluster members staying in a given place of accommodation and  standard deviational ellipses are shown. Most tourists in each cluster  congregate in towns located near the large lakes along the main sailing  route. There are, however, some differences.  Cyclists  stay close to the largest lakes, exploring the area along the  north–south axis. Their dispersion along the east–west axis is the  smallest among all groups. The semi-minor axis of cyclists’ standard  deviational ellipse constitutes only 28% of the semi-major axis.  Water  recreationists  are present in all of main locations almost equally.  Members of this cluster are also accommodated in towns that are not on  the main sailing route. This group has the largest range, and their  standard deviational ellipse occupies 46% of the study area.  Passive  tourists  congregate principally in towns in the central and northern part  of the study area, while they are far less numerous in villages. They only  explore 36% of the study area.  Anglers , in turn, use small lakes much  more intensively than other groups and are mostly accommodated off  the main tourist trail (except for the two main tourist hubs: Mikołajki  and Giżycko).  Anglers  and  non-angling sailors  have similar standard deviational ellipses. The disproportion between semi-axes is smallest, the  semi-minor axis comprising around 43% of the major axis, indicating  that they are widespread over the region.  Angling sailors  are the only  group who are mainly accommodated on lakes or in villages. They  principally explore the largest interconnected lakes and tend to stay in  the northern part of the sailing route, which is less crowded. At the  same time, their range of exploration is limited (36% of the study area).  Average Nearest Neighbour analysis shows that all groups are spatially  aggregated, while  angling  and  non-angling sailors  are most aggregated  (ratio = 0.26, confidence level 99%). This is likely to be due to the environment: sailing space is principally limited to interconnected large  lakes. The ratio of the other four groups is around 0.46 (confidence level  99%), which also indicates a high level of spatial aggregation within  clusters. It is much higher than the ratio of all the beds in accommodation  facilities, which means that the accommodation facilities are much more  concentrated in the study area than the clusters’ members.  A deeper analysis of tourists' distribution uses a Multi-Distance  Spatial Cluster Analysis based on Ripley's K Function. This finds two  spatial behaviours.  Angling sailors  is the only group that is aggregated in  all distance ranges, indicating that wherever they are in the study area  they tend to stay in groups. This is similar to the accommodation facilities, which are also aggregated in all distance ranges. For the other  five clusters, tourists are aggregated up to a certain distance from the  geometric centre of the class, ranging from 10 km ( non-angling sailors ) to  14 km ( anglers ). Finally,  Fig. 9  shows that the spatial behaviour of the  latter groups of tourists is random.  4.4.4.

              " tourists by activity in a nature-based destination seems to be a  particularly useful way to find out how they use it. Such knowledge  may not only serve the tourism industry ( Mehmetoglu, 2007 ), but also  contribute to our knowledge of the human–nature relationship. Our  study shows that the method works well in practice, as significant  differences between clusters were identified.  The continuous growth of tourism in natural areas requires an ongoing search for new methods and instruments to help in assessing how  tourists use and value nature. This knowledge is crucial in improving  the planning and management of nature-based destinations. Our research not only presents an activity-based segmentation, but also goes  one step further by adding spatial analyses and the Travel Cost Method.  It demonstrates that combining all of these methods can do more than  just segment tourists into relatively homogenous, activity-based groups.  Like many other studies, the framework makes it possible to characterize each group by its social and demographic features and travel  patterns. However, clusters can also be described by their spatial behaviour and the economic value they give to nature. The findings show  that cluster analysis, which is principally a marketing tool used by  companies to segment visitors, may be also an extremely useful tool for  planners and destination managers. In this way, the study takes a holistic approach to the analysis of tourism demand in a nature-based  destination, and, as such, contributes to the discussion on tourists’ use  of a nature-based destination.

Methodology  In this study, we explore tourist complaining practices on social  media and their potential for value co-creation and co-destruction, in a  naturalistic context. In doing so, we consider whether each complaint  practice could be characterized by a distinct type of customer value  ( Sheth et al., 1991 ;  Smith &amp; Colgate, 2007 ) which may form during the  performances of complaining on social media. Our investigation focuses  on the dynamic interactions between consumers and the organization,  and between consumers themselves, that are observable on the Facebook pages of a large Australian-based airline company  Qantas,  and its  low-cost airline subsidiary  Jetstar.  The Qantas Group is the largest  airline in Oceania ranked by the number of passengers transported  (53.5 million in 2016/2017 FY). The  Qantas  Facebook page had  828,933 fans when this research was conducted, growing on average by  8232 new fans per month. The  Jetstar  Australia Facebook page had  630,911 fans, growing steadily with an average of 1877 new fans  joining the page per week. Each of these Facebook pages offers  visitor  posts , a feature whereby consumers can post freely on the public forum.  Consequently, these pages are a common space for consumers to express their complaints ( Cakmak &amp; Isaac, 2012 ), which makes these  social media pages an appropriate research site for our study.

Consistent  with previous studies ( Mariani, Di Felice, &amp; Mura, 2016 ;  Mariani, Mura,  &amp; Di Felice, 2018 ), this study focuses on Facebook, as it is the most-used  social media platform among national tourism organizations ( Mariani  et al., 2018 ) and individuals, with more than 2.23 billion monthly active users ( Statista, 2018 ). The  ‘ visitor posts ’  were extracted using  NCapture software, a web browser extension designed to capture online  content, such as social media posts. The extracted content was then  imported to NVivo for further analysis. During this six month period,  there were 915 original visitor posts on  Qantas  and 1098 original visitor  posts on the  Jetstar  pages respectively. Of these posts, over threequarters reflected some form of complaint. The total data downloaded  amounted to more than 292 single-spaced pages of 12-point-font text,  representing approximately 130,348 words, as well as significant visual  data in the form of uploaded photos. The total number of postings in  which a complaint behavior was observed was approximately 1509.  We adopted a two-stage iterative process to analyze the data: in the first stage, we conducted an open-ended exploration of the conversations that appeared on the social media pages with the purpose of understanding the context of such conversations and of particular complaints that they reflected. The \n",

At this stage, we also developed provisional  categories and conceptual connections by using the constant comparative method, where we would go back and forth dialogically between the emergent themes from the posts and the elements of practices  from the literature ( Schau et al., 2009 ;  Shove &amp; Pantzar, 2005 ).

At the second stage, we revisited our preliminary theme of tourist  complaining practices with the purpose of understanding how the  specific interactive performances by actors (i.e., consumers and organizations) resulted in either co-creative or co-destructive value formation ( Echeverri &amp; Skålén, 2011 ). In particular, we analyzed how value  formation unfolded dynamically within the interactions observable on  social media for each complaining practice, paying particular attention  to the specific aspects of the actors ’  performances (e.g., language, observable intentions, specific tactics, etc.) that contributed to co-creation  or co-destruction. Such an approach enabled us to identify common  patterns of interactive performances that fostered co-creation or codestruction, thereby extending our analysis to account for the potential  of tourist complaint practices to foster these two dimensions of value  formation ( Echeverri &amp; Skålén, 2011 ). This second and final iteration  formed the basis for refining our themes in their final form, which are  presented in the findings. Trustworthiness was ensured through regular  discussions of emerging interpretations between the authors to allow  for multiple interpretations, while adhering to the principle of suspicion  ( Klein &amp; Myers, 1999 ). In addition, a summary of findings was offered  to a colleague (assistant professor level) for comments, and these were  used to amend the article. </div></span>"

Methodology  This section describes our framework for travel itinerary analysis  based on topic modeling. The frameworks contains four major stages: 1)  Travel Data Collection : Collecting travel data that capture the travel  behavior and activities of tourists; 2)  Itinerary Construction : Processing  of raw travel data into a suitable format that represents travel itineraries; 3)  Probabilistic Topic Modeling : Applying topic modeling techniques to formatted travel itineraries to discover underlying travel topics;  and 4)  Exploratory Analysis : Conducting statistical analysis of the discovered topics with respect to travel groups and destination countries  for insights into travel behavior. The details of these four stages are  presented in this section.  3.1. Travel Data Collection  This stage collects travel data that capture the comprehensive travel  behavior and activities of tourists along their trips. We employ usergenerated data on social media sites, such venue check-ins ( Vu et al.,  2018a ), as our data source owing to their large-scale availability with  comprehensive activity information. Venue check-ins, especially on the  Foursquare platform, have been shown to be effective in capturing the  travel activities of tourists ( Kotiloglu, Lappas, Pelechrinis, &amp; Repoussis,  2017 ;  Luo et al., 2019 ) and reflecting their implicit interests in the  visited locations or venues ( Kessler, 2010 ). One issue with Foursquare is  that there is no function to directly identify users and their check-in  records. However, with the integration of their systems, Foursquare  check-ins can be extracted via the Twitter platform.  The process of extracting venue check-in data is carried out in two  steps. First, Foursquare users who have integrated their system with the  Twitter platform are identified by using a streaming function, which is  available in Twitter's application programming interface (API) (developer.twitter.com/en/docs.html). The streaming function can retrieve  random tweets being generated all over the world in real time. We  apply a filter using the keyword  “ swarmapp ”  to extract only tweets  generated by the Foursquare check-in application Swarm. The check-in  tweets are collected together with their meta data, such as UserID and  Location of Origin, which are useful in identifying individual users of  interests. For instance, if we are interested in studying the travel behavior of users from a specific country, then the UserID of users having  the same country of origin are selected for further data extraction. In  the second step, the travel history of selected users is extracted by using  another of Twitter's API function, called getUserTimeline. This function  is deployed with the keyword  “ swarmapp ”  to extract check-in tweets  available in the Twitter \n",

              "    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">METHOD</span>\n",
              "</mark>\n",
              " of such users.  Once the check-in tweets are collected, we extract a link in the meta  data that points to the original check-ins on Foursquare to extract relevant information about the check-ins. These data include venue name,  location, category, local date, and time, all of which are useful to  construct travel itineraries in the next stage. We are aware that Twitter  has a quota limit for free access to its API. However, the streaming  function can be kept deployed for a long time. Moreover, massive volumes of data are generated every day, and so the collected data set is  large and su ffi cient for studying the travel behavior of tourists ( Cheng,  Caverlee, Lee, &amp; Sui, 2011 ).  3.2. Itinerary Construction  The collected venue check-in data need to be processed and transformed into a suitable format before topic modeling can be applied.  Foursquare provides a comprehensive list of venue categories classified  into 10 major types, including Art and Entertainment, College and  University, Event, Food, Nightlife Spot, Outdoors and Recreation,  Professional and Other Places, Residence, Shop and Service, and Travel  and  Transport  ( https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/  categories ). Each type contains multiple categories and subcategories.  The check-ins of each user are arranged according to the temporal order  of date and time. Each check-in records a visit of the tourist to a specific  venue, which is useful to infer associated activities. For instance, a  check-in at a restaurant could indicate dining, while a check-in at a  shopping mall or department store could indicate shopping activities.  Travel itineraries can be constructed in different ways depending on  the study contexts of inbound or outbound travel behavior. If researchers are interested in studying the travel behavior of a specific  group of users, the check-ins made by those users outside of their home  countries can be used to study their outbound travel behavior. Checkins made in the home country of the users, but in different cities or  town, can be used to study their domestic travel behavior. If the context  of study is on inbound tourism, then the check-ins of all visitors in a  specific destination are collected for analysis. The itineraries can be  constructed and analyzed at the trip level, spanning multiple days for  overall understanding on their trip preference, or at the daily level to  provide detailed insights into their behavior and daily activities.  The aim of travel itinerary analysis using topic modeling is to  identify the activities that are commonly included in the same itineraries for travel package development and recommendation. Therefore,  only travel itineraries that contain a su ffi cient number of check-ins to  the travel patterns are included in the analysis. The minimum number  of check-ins varies depending on the analysis context. A high minimum  threshold can be specified for trip-level analysis, while a low minimum  threshold can be specified for daily-level analysis.  3.3. Probabilistic topic modeling  Given a set of collected travel itineraries, the next stage is to apply  topic modeling to discover the topics hidden within, which represent  the profile of itineraries and the preferences of tourists. We utilize a  probabilistic topic modeling technique, \n",

Specifically, each state's ranking  was based on the following method.  (1)  where  is the GDP weight of the leisure and hospitality  industry of state  i . Then, the states were ranked based on the respective  GDP weights of the leisure and hospitality industry. The top five and  bottom five states based on the rankings were selected to examine the  extent to which changes in the employee earnings in the leisure and  hospitality industry are caused by changes in employee earnings in the  overall U.S. economy and the overall state economy, controlling for the  importance of the leisure and hospitality industry in the state's  economy. Accordingly, we included Nevada (rank #1), Hawaii (rank  #2), Vermont (rank #3), Florida (rank#4), and Montana (rank #5) in  the top five portfolio; and Wisconsin (rank #47), Iowa (rank #48),  Nebraska (rank #49), Delaware (rank #50), and North Dakota (rank  #51) in the bottom five portfolio.  Average weekly employee wages (full time employees) data were  used to estimate employee earnings growth rates, which was obtained  from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the United States  Department of Labor.

The GDP data were obtained  from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a unit of the United States  Department of Commerce.  Importantly, the Bureau of Labor Statistics classifies the hospitality  industry together with the leisure industry. That is, based on the Bureau  of Labor Statistics ’  definition, subsectors of the hospitality industry are  classified under the leisure and hospitality major sector. Therefore, the  comparisons and analyses in major industries were made based on the  leisure and hospitality industry. Nevertheless, further analyses were  conducted to investigate employee earnings growth in the subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes the main hospitality  sectors.  3.2. Empirical design  Ordinary least square regression was used to estimate the market  model, which predicts the relationship between the employee earnings  growth rate in a particular industry and in the overall economy. To  estimate the market model, the earnings growth rate was calculated as  follows.  (2)  where  is the earnings growth rate of industry  i  on time  t ,  is the  average weekly earnings for industry  i  in time  t , and  is the average  weekly earnings for industry  i  in time  t-1.  To estimate the earnings  growth and volatility, we employed the market model. The model is  specified as follows.  (3)  where  is the earnings growth rate of industry  i  in time t,  is the  earnings growth rate in the overall U.S. economy in time t, which is  calculated using  formula (2) ,  is the random disturbance term, and and  are the market model parameters. All models include year fixed  effects to control for time-specific economic and other conditions over  time. We also include month fixed effects and quarter fixed effects to  control for seasonality in the monthly data and quarterly data, respectively. Furthermore, state level analyses include state fixed effects  to control for state-specific dynamics and characteristics.  The beta coe ffi cient,  shows the extent to which earnings in an  industry move in parallel with the earnings in overall U.S. economy.  That is, a  of 1.5 suggests that employee earnings in industry  i  increase  by 1.5% when employee earnings in in the overall U.S. economy increase by 1% in a given period. Conversely, a  of 0.5 indicates that  employee earnings in industry  i  increase by only 0.5% when employee  earnings in the overall U.S. economy increase by 1% in a given period.  The beta coe ffi cient is labeled as a measure of economy-driven growth  in employee earnings in industry  i . The alpha coe ffi cient,  shows the  extent to which earnings in an industry increase or decrease independently of the overall economy. If alpha, for example, is equal to  0.5, it suggests that employee earnings in industry  i  have increased  0.5% independently of the increases in employee earnings in the U.S.  economy. The alpha coe ffi cient is a measure of industry-driven growth  in employee earnings in industry  i.  3.3. Summary statistics  Fig. 1  presents the historical employee earnings (CPI adjusted) of  major sectors in the U.S. for the period between 2006 and 2018. Notably, employee earnings in the leisure and hospitality industry are  below the average employee earnings in the U.S. While industries like  trade, transportation, and utilities and other services (except public  administration), for instance, are also below the average employee  earnings in the U.S., earnings in the leisure and hospitality industry are  the lowest during this period.  To put the employee earnings in these industries in perspective, the  mean differences between employee earnings in major industries and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. were analyzed. The industries  were ranked based on their average earnings, where industries with  higher earnings ranked in the highest order.  Table 1  presents these findings. The results show that employee earnings in the U.S. as a whole  were $710, on average, while employee earnings in the leisure and  hospitality industry were $311. Indeed, the difference is not only statistically but also economically significant.  We further analyzed the mean differences between employee  earnings in the subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industries and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. We also ranked the subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality based on their average earnings, where industries with higher earnings ranked in the highest order.  Table 2  presents these results.  The results show that the mean differences between employee  earnings in the subsectors of the leisure and hospitality industry and  overall employee earnings in the U.S. are significantly different. The  independent artists, writers, and performers (NAICS 711500) and  spectator sports (NAICS 711200) industries are the only subsectors of  the leisure and hospitality industry with employee earnings higher than  the average employee earnings in the U.S. Although still lower than the  average employee earnings in the U.S., employee earnings in the arts,  entertainment, and recreation (NAICS 71) super sector and its subsectors, such as museums (NAICS 712110), historical sites (NAICS  712120), and so on appear to be better than earnings in the accommodation and food services (NAICS 72) super sector and its subsectors,  such as full-service restaurants (NAICS 722100), hotels (except casino  hotels) and motels (NAICS 721110), etc. Restaurants, in general, appear  to have the lowest employee earnings. Specifically, the limited-service  eating places (NAICS 722200) sub-sector has the lowest earnings with  $232 average weekly earnings. </div></span>"

In the first step, quantitative data are collected via an online questionnaire sent to tourism firms in Austria, a country with a well-established tourism industry, encompassing 140.9 million overnight stays  in 2016 and ranking 5th out of 29 European tourism regions ( WKO,  2018 ). About 20% of the country's workforce is directly or indirectly  employed in this sector and in 2015, the tourism industry's direct and  indirect contribution constituted 16.1% of the country's GDP (Tirol  Werbung, 2017 ). In a second step, to interpret and extend the explanatory power of the results of fsQCA, a qualitative follow-up study  with owner-managers that display features of each one of the configurations from the sample of tourism firms in the earlier quantitative  study is conducted.  3.1. Quantitative sample  To assure heterogeneity and representativeness among the firms in  the sample, 1000 randomly selected firms from the tourism and hospitality industry in the Austrian Chamber of Commerce's database of  owner-manager led firms ( Getz et al., 2004 ), the dominant form of  Austrian tourism firms ( Doerflinger, Doerflinger, Gavac, &amp; Vogl, 2013 ),  were invited via email to participate in a \n",

Eventually, 13 face-to-face  interviews representing all configurations, and with an average duration of 36 min were conducted from December 2017 to February 2018.  Table 2  provides an overview of these sample firms. Different types of  tourism firms such as hotels, restaurants, cafés, ski schools, apartment  rentals and sports outfitters were considered for this follow-up study.  However, since the hotel sector is dominant in Austrian tourism (Tirol  Werbung, 2017 ), it is somewhat inevitable that most of the firms in the  sample were predominantly active in hospitality.  3.3. Quantitative study  3.3.1. Measures  Data for the quantitative study was measured using 5-point Likerttype scales (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). To measure EO,  the three sub-dimension scales from  Eggers et al. (2013)  were used,  who adapted the original  Covin and Slevin (1989)  scales to a small-firm  context:  Innovativeness  was measured with a five-item scale, particularly  focusing on innovation behavior.  Proactiveness  was assessed with a fiveitem scale, measuring how eager firms are to identify and take advantage of market opportunities.  Risk-taking  was evaluated with a fouritem scale, which concentrates on measuring the perception and management of uncertainty and risk within a company.  Networking  was  measured with the two-item scale from  Hills and Hultman (2006) ,  which evaluates a company's information exchange with its personal  and professional network. Financial resource constraints were measured by assessing financial  resource availability  on a four-item scale  ( Atuahene-Gima et al., 2005 ).  Environmental uncertainty  was measured  on a three-item scale reporting the technological turbulence in the  business environment based on  Narver et al. (2004)  and  AtuaheneGima  et al.  (2005) .  Following  numerous  studies  from  the  entrepreneurship domain (e.g.,  Chen, Tzeng, Ou, &amp; Chang, 2007 ;  Davidsson, Steffens, &amp; Fitzsimmons, 2009 ;  Eggers et al., 2013 ),  performance  was measured as an index of sales, profit, employee and market  share growth.

              ", the 20% first and 20% last respondents  were compared via an ANOVA, as late respondents tend to be more  similar to non-respondents ( Armstrong &amp; Overton, 1977 ). No significant differences for these two groups were found.  Following similar studies using fsQCA in an entrepreneurship context (e.g.,  Hughes et al., 2018  or;  Kraus, Mensching, Calabrò, Cheng, &amp;  Filser, 2016 ), the sample was split into two groups for comparison  reasons. As previous research identified environmental uncertainty to  be one of the major drivers for entrepreneurial behavior (e.g.,  Bstieler,  2005 ), a  high  and a  low environmental uncertainty  group was defined to  consider the effect of these external forces influencing entrepreneurship  development in the tourism industry ( Carmichael &amp; Morrison, 2011 ;  Köseoglu et al., 2013 ). These  environmental uncertainty  groups were  developed on the basis of average uncertainty ( Ragin, 2008 ), using the  mean of 3.02 as a guiding value, which means that all firms with an  environmental uncertainty value below this number were considered  group 1 (low uncertainty; 72 firms) and all with a value identical or  above the mean were considered group 2 (high uncertainty; 41 firms).  3.3.2. FsQCA technique  Data were further analyzed by employing the analytical set-membership technique fsQCA, which stems from complexity theory ( Ragin,  2008 ) and is used to categorize antecedents into causal configurations  ( Chang &amp; Cheng, 2014 ;  Cheng, Chang, &amp; Li, 2013 ;  Kraus, RibeiroSoriano, &amp; Schüssler, 2018 ). FsQCA allows researchers to overcome  various limitations that are part of regression-based analysis as it enables the identification of complex combinations of conditions that  result in particular outcomes ( Skarmeas, Leonidou, &amp; Saridakis, 2014 ).  Contrary to traditional techniques that treat causal conditions as independent variables, fsQCA offers a logical representation and analysis  of causal conditions and exhibits configurations of conditions. The  method facilitates the examination of how different combinations explain a result and offers a reason for more than a single combination of  conditions that lead to above-average outcomes ( Woodside, 2013 ) such  as firm performance, which was the goal of this study and followed the  strong interest of extant literature to focus on explaining high firm  performance (e.g.,  Hughes et al., 2018 ;  Kraus et al., 2016 ).  For the calculation, it is necessary to determine values for the  transformation of common data into fuzzy sets on the basis of  Ragin  (2008)  and  Woodside (2013) . Accordingly, the process of transforming  variables into sets requires the specification of full membership (95%),  full non-membership (5%), and cross-over anchors (50%) in order to  transform antecedents and performance into fuzzy variables. This study  set the original values of 5.0, 3.0, and 1.0 from five-point Likert scales  based on  Ragin (2008)  and  Woodside (2013)  to respectively correspond  to these memberships.  In addition, this study focused on using the truth table algorithm to  recognize configurations that are su ffi cient for the outcome by selecting  both the minimum recommended consistent cut-off value as 0.75 and  the number-of-cases threshold as 1 based on  Fiss (2011)  and  Ragin  (2008) . Setting the number of cases threshold to 1 means that a con- figuration of factors needed to appear in at least one case to be considered a relevant outcome. Maintaining a threshold of 1 also means  that logical remainders are eliminated and that all cases are considered  in the identified configurations. This way, this study follows Ragin's  procedure (2008), who finds intermediate solutions (i.e., only logical  remainders based on easy counterfactuals are used) superior to both  complex (i.e., no logical remainders are used) and parsimonious solutions (i.e., all logical remainders are considered whether they are based  on easy or di ffi cult counterfactuals). The cut-off value was set to 0.75,  so the configurations that are su ffi cient to the outcome could be recognized ( Fiss, 2011 ). The fsQCA truth table algorithm ( Ragin, 2008 )  was then utilized to generate various, possible and logical combinations  of su ffi cient causal conditions in low and high uncertainty environments that lead to an above-average performance.  3.4. Qualitative follow-up study  As recommended by  Woodside (2014) , a qualitative follow-up study  was conducted to gain deeper insights into the performance configurations identified by fsQCA. This type of analysis makes it possible to  generalize beyond distinct examples but also enables researchers to  gain a better insight by examining individual cases ( Ragin, 2008 ). This  meets the idea of prior \n",

Owner-managers from each of the configurations identified in the  quantitative study were interviewed. Questions drew on the items from  the quantitative study and management literature ( Atuahene-Gima  et al., 2005 ;  Covin &amp; Slevin, 1989 ;  Eggers et al., 2013 ;  Hills &amp; Hultman,  2006 ) and are summarized in  Table 4 . Further optional functional  questions were asked to understand how the interviewees perceive respective factors to work and influence the performance of their firm ( De  Massis &amp; Kotlar, 2014 ).  The interviews were all tape-recorded and transcribed. In a next  step, the content of the interviews was structured according to the  identified configurations from the quantitative study. As the original  data were in German, relevant quotes illustrating the different configurations were independently translated into English by two of the authors to ensure accuracy and meaningful translations of quotes. Finally,  the translations were compared and a professional language editor was  consulted to ensure precise wording. As well as helping to interpret the  results of the quantitative study, the gathered information of the followup study also helped to name the six identified categories from the  quantitative study. </div></span>"

              " to construct the evaluation index system of ecological security of natural  heritage tourism. Although the previous literature has made numerous  efforts to measure tourism ecological security from different research  perspectives, there remains the unsolved question of index comprehensiveness and internal system operation. Some controversies surrounding the methods used to measure tourism ecological security,  such as incomplete measurement methods and inadequate selection of  indicators, meaning the status of tourism ecological security cannot be  accurately evaluated. Therefore, to improve the important evaluation  method of tourism ecological security, this study is based on ecosystem  theory, and deeply analyses the definition and connotations of tourism  ecological security in several steps. First, we select a relatively comprehensive DPSIR framework to create the evaluation system, which  makes up for the problem of incomplete index selection in previous  studies. Second, we combine the efficiency evaluation method to  measure the “quality” of tourism ecological security, which can address  the problem of previous research only evaluating the “quantity” of  tourism ecological security ( Dong et al., 2018 ).  2.3. DPSIR framework  The Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) model was established in 1993 by the European Environmental Agency (OECD)  based on the PSR and DSR frameworks: “Driver” and “Impact” indicators were added in DPSIR conceptual framework ( Waheed, Khan, &amp;  Veitch, 2009 ). The DPSIR model examines the interrelationship between people and the environment from a system perspective. This  model is systematic and comprehensive, and enables a more comprehensive monitoring of the continuous feedback mechanism between the  indicators. Importantly, one of the main goals of the DPSIR model is to  assess efficiency ( Ness, Anderberg, &amp; Olsson, 2010 ), which is mostly  used for environmental assessment, resource management ( Kagalou,  Leonardos, Anastasiadou, &amp; Neofytou, 2012 ), etc. However, few studies  have focused on it. Only the latest research regards DPSIR model as an  important guiding framework to explore the index construction of  sustainable development ( Asmelash &amp; Kumar, 2019 ), which shows the  completeness  and effectiveness of the DPSIR model.  The DPSIR model can effectively measure the operational status of  the tourism ecosystem. Compared with other evaluation models, the  advantages of the DPSIR model are found in two aspects. First, the  DPSIR model has the advantages of comprehensive content and strong  logic ( Ehara et al., 2018 ), and DPSIR framework fully reflects the interaction relationship among tourists, tourism destinations and environment. Specifically, “driver” is a potential factor that puts pressure  on the tourism ecosystem, including the direct drivers and indirect  drivers of tourism economic development and social and economic  development. ‘Pressure’ comprises the factors that pose a threat to  tourism ecological security through the direct effects of the driver, reflecting the consumption of resources by tourists and local residents  that end up causing environmental pollution and other pressures  ( Benitez-Capistros, Hugé, &amp; Koedam, 2014 ). “State” is the state of coordination of the tourism economy, ecological environment and  tourism industry under pressure. The “impact” is the comprehensive  impact on the development of the social economy and the tourism industry when the tourism ecosystem is under shock and pressure ( Li,  2004 ). “Response” comprises some measures  provide d to maintain the  stable operation of the tourism ecosystem; these measures include  prevention, compensation, and improvement ( Cooper, 2013 ). Second,  the DPSIR framework shows that the “circulation” characteristics of the  ecosystem operation and its critical five indicators have a “ring” relationship with a single direction ( Wang, Sun, Li, &amp; Zou, 2016 ). The  hidden drivers that cause risks affect the good environmental status,  resulting in a series of pressures, such as people and nature, people and  tourism, tourism and nature. Once the tourism ecosystem is in an unbalanced state, it will counteract the social economy and tourism development. In this case, a series of corresponding measures are needed  to actively respond, and the response levels will affect the coordinated  development of the tourism ecosystem.  Importantly, scholars have proposed that it could be improved in  combination with other methods ( Bell, 2012 ;  Maxim, Spangenberg, &amp;  O'Connor, 2009 ). The traditional DPSIR model only measures the development status of each subject of regional tourism ecological security  ( Malekmohammadi &amp; Jahanishakib, 2017 ). It cannot comprehensively  evaluate the internal interaction and operational efficiency of the  tourism ecosystem, however, and unable to evaluate whether the factor  investment of tourism destination effectively meets its ecological security  needs. Moreover, ecosystem theory asserts that the elements of the  system must reach a state of coordination and unification ( Reynolds,  2002 ), and this kind of harmonious and unified state can be measured  through efficiency. Therefore, efficiency evaluation is the best way to  measure the input and output of resources to reflect the comprehensive  effect of the input and output of factors such as the economic development of tourism activities and ecological environment, rather than the  result of a single factor input or output ( Zha, He, Liu, &amp; Shao, 2019 ).  Which reflects that tourism ecological security is the comprehensive effect of the input and output of factors such as economic development of  tourism activities and ecological environment etc, rather than the result  of a single factor input or output. Therefore, this study combines the  DPSIR framework with the DEA efficiency model to improve the tourism  ecological security evaluation model.  2.4. Current gaps in the literature  To better clarify the necessity of this study’ s exploration of the  innovation of tourism ecological security evaluation methods and the  critical driving mechanism, we comprehensively review the related  previous studies, and highlight the current research gaps in the tourism  studies sector.  First, we examine the perspective of the foundational theory for  tourism ecological security evaluation. Previous studies have  ignore d  the need to provide a theoretical basis for tourism ecological security  measures; however, a strong theoretical background is not only helpful  to clarify the interactions among the multiple subjects in the tourism  ecosystem but also to transform the complex system operation mechanism into simple explanations ( Gursoy &amp; Nunkoo, 2019 ).  Peng et al.  (2018)  asserted that to maintain the security of the ecosystem, certain  elements must be maintained in a coordinated and unified state. Further, ecosystem theory provides important theoretical background and  guides us to realize that tourism ecological security must consider the  balanced state of the input and output of each factor in the system  evaluation ( Dong et al., 2018 ). Therefore, this paper introduces the  ecosystem theory as the foundation of the explanation of the tourism  ecological security.  Second, although many evaluation models for tourism ecological  security have been established by tourism scholars, such as Ecological  Conservation Development Areas(ECDA) ( Tang et al., 2018 ), the  TOPSIS method ( Xu, Liu, Li, &amp; Zhong, 2017 ), and spatio-temporal dynamics analysis ( Lu, Wang, Xie, Li, &amp; Xu, 2016 ), they cannot fully cover  the multiple elements in the system, which shows the unilateral evaluation results, ignoring the comprehensive index and the dynamic  development. This study introduces the “Driver-Pressure-State-ImpactResponse&quot; framework, which not only fully reflects the affinity relationships among the tourist, destination and environment and multilevel characteristics of the assessment element but also notes the circulation characteristics of the system’ s dynamic development.  Third, scholars often use a single evaluation framework or model to  evaluate tourism ecological security. Tourism scholars note, however,  that the combination of assessment framework and multiple methods is  the trend of future assessment, which not only provides diverse perspectives for phenomena explanations, but is also helpful in examining  complex systems ( Bell, 2012 ). Therefore, this study integrates the  DPSIR framework and SBM-DEA method and provides innovative perspective in the evaluation of tourism ecological security.  Fourth, previous studies have asserted that exploring the influencing factors is helpful to identify the obstacles to tourism ecological  security ( Peng et al., 2018 ). Most scholars, however, used regression  equations or qualitative studies to explain tourism ecological security  ( Tang et al., 2018 ), which failed to identify the core influencing factors,  and supplied no addition detail with regard to developmental strategies. Therefore, this study uses the Geo-Detector method to identify the  core influencing factors of tourism ecological security.  Fifth and finally, although previous studies have summarized the  formation path of tourism ecological security, the construction of the  driving mechanism remains an unsolved question, and as a result, the  operation mechanism of tourism ecological security cannot be systematically constructed ( Xu et al., 2017 ). Based on the DPSIR framework  and the core influencing factors, this study constructs the driving mechanism of tourism ecological security in an all-around and multi-level  way, which is a key contribution.  3. Method and data  3.1. Research method  3.1.1. DPSIR-DEA model  The DPSIR-DEA framework was used to measure the tourism ecological security of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Data Envelopment  Analysis (DEA) is an analytical method proposed by two American  operation researchers,  Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes in 1978  to evaluate  relative efficiency. However, because of today's more complex economic, social and ecological systems, the selection of a single DEA indicator faces a series problems, such as incompleteness and lack of  rationality. Thus, the combination of the DPSIR framework and the DEA  model not only comprehensively covers relevant indicators but also  accurately measures operational efficiency. It is worth noting that the  classical DEA method based on the CCR and BCC models fails to fully  consider relaxation problems of input and output, resulting in deviations  efficiency  measurement  ( Hosseinzadeh  Lotfi,  Jahanshahloo,  Givehchi, &amp; Vaez-Ghasemi, 2013 ). Subsequently, Tone constructed an  undesirable output relaxation metric (Super-SBM) model based on environmental production techniques, which solved the problem of nonzero slack in input or output, and undesired output problems in the  roduction process. Further, these model changes avoid radial and  deviation problems caused by radial and angle selection differences  ( Tone, 2001 ), better reflecting the nature of tourism ecological security  evaluation. Therefore, DPSIR, an evaluation framework covering multiple system elements, was  introduce d, and SMB-DEA is used to solve  the problem of undesired output and measurement of environmental  efficiency ( Wang, Zhang, Fan, Lu, &amp; Yang, 2019 ). A new evaluation  method that combines the DPSIR framework with SMB-DEA model was  created. The mathematical expression is as follows:  (1)  where  ρ represents tourism ecological security while  N ,  M , and  I  represent the number of inputs, desirable outputs, and undesirable outputs, respectively.   ,   and   represent the  slack variables of the input-output, the input-output values of the  production unit  k  at time  v , and the weight of each input-output.  Moreover, the greater the  ρ  value, the higher the security.  In addition, this study used  Wang's et al. (2016)  suggestion to disassemble the DPSIR ring structure into an annual linear structure to  more intuitively present the cyclic characteristics of the DPSIR model  ( Wang et al., 2016 ). Impact and State are the output factors in the  operation of the tourism ecosystem. Moreover, Driver, Pressure and the  Response of the previous year are the necessary input factors for the  efficiency result, which affects the cyclic operation of the system.  Therefore, the study uses Driver, Pressure of tourism and social response as the input factors, the State and Impact as the desirable output  factors, and the ecological destruction pressure as the undesirable  output factor in the DEA model.  3.1.2. Spatial autocorrelation  3.1.2.1. Global spatial autocorrelation . Global autocorrelation is used to  measure the spatial agglomeration characteristics of tourism ecological  security in the YRD. Moran's I index is a commonly used indicator for  global spatial agglomeration effects. The formulas are as follows:  (2)  where  I  indicates Moran's I index;  N  is the number of research units; and  are the attribute values on the  i  and  j  study units, respectively; is the average value of ;  is the sum of all the elements of the spatial  weight \n",

              "</mark>\n",
              " of the study units  i  and  j . The value of  Moran's I  ranges from −1 to 1.  3.1.2.2. Local spatial autocorrelation . Spatial autocorrelation describes  the spatial differentiation characteristic of the research units in the  region in more detail.  Getis-Ord G  is used to measure local spatial  differentiation characteristics and to identify the spatial distribution of  cold spots and hot spots, using the following mathematical expression:  (3)  where  n  is the number of research units; and  are the attribute values  on the  i  and  j  space units, respectively; and  is the spatial weight  \n",
              "<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n",

              "</mark>\n",
              ". If  G  is positive and significant, indicating the value of position  i ,  and the surrounding areas are relatively high, that is the high level  accumulation area (hot spot area). Conversely,  G  is negative and  significant, this indicates that the value around position  i  is lower than  the mean, belonging to the low level accumulation area (cold spot area).  3.1.3. Geo-detector  Geo-Detector is mainly used to detect differences in geographical  elements and the influencing factors of spatial distribution. Further, the  factor detector is used to detect whether a certain geographical factor is  the reason for the difference in spatial distribution ( Wang et al., 2010 ).  This study uses the Geo-Detector factor detection model to explore the  influencing factors of the spatial characteristics of tourism ecological  security. The main idea is that the relevant factors affecting tourism  ecological security are spatially different. If the factor and the level of  tourism ecological security are spatially significant, it indicates that this  factor is decisive for the spatial distribution of tourism ecological security. The Geo-Detector method used can effectively detect the core  influencing factors of regional tourism ecological security ( Shi et al.,  2018 ). Compared with the traditional regression method used in previous studies, Geo-Detector can not only effectively analyze the differences of spatial influencing factors but also identify the core factors.  Geo-Detector provides a powerful methodological application foundation for how practitioners take action in the future. The specific calculation formula is as follows ( Wang &amp; Hu, 2012 ):  (4)  where  presents the detection force value of the detection factor  D ;  is  the sample size of the entire region;  is the number of samples in the  sublevel region;  is the number of sublevel regions;   is the \n",

In addition, the selection of  input and output indicators is directly related to the science and accuracy of the evaluation ( Korhonen &amp; Luptacik, 2004 ).

Moreover, water consumption per 10,000 yuan reflects  the levels of energy consumption and regional energy use efficiency. Further, waste water discharge and soot emissions as negative factors in economic development may cause serious damage  to regional ecological environment.  (3) State (S) ( Chen, Thapa, &amp; Yan, 2018 ;  Lu, Li, Pang, Xue, &amp; Miao,  2018 ). Five indexes – garden green space, per capita park green  area, green area of built-up area, proportion of tertiary industry in  GDP, and total tourism revenue in GDP – are selected as output  indicators. The status indexes are mainly selected from the ecological environment and industrial economic development aspects.  Specifically, the area of garden green space, the per capita park  green area, and green coverage area of established areas represent  the levels of environmental health and sustainable development.  Moreover, the proportion of tertiary industry in GDP reflects the  industrial structure of regions, and the proportion of total tourism  revenue in GDP reflects the contribution of the tourism industry.

As the output factors of the tourism ecosystem, these  indexes can reflect the impact of system operations on tourism.  (5) Response (R) ( Liu, Zhang, et al., 2018 ;  Wang et al., 2016 ). The  sewage treatment rate, life garbage treatment rate, the proportion  of fiscal expenditure to GDP, and the number of students in ordinary high schools are selected as the input factors for the following year. The sewage treatment rate and life garbage treatment  rate are critical contributors to the sustainable development of the  ecological environment. Moreover, fiscal expenditure reflects the  economic impetus to invest in the ecological environment, and the  number of students in ordinary colleges and universities reflects the  supply of talent for response measures.  Combining the needs and data availability of the DPSIR and DEA  models, this study selects 6 secondary indicators and 26 tertiary indicators, including driver, tourism and social pressure, ecological  pressure, states, impact and response. Among them, driver, tourism and  social pressure and response are input factors. The state and impact are  the desirable output factors, and the ecological pressure is the undesirable output factor. Lastly, the index is standardized, and the  weight of the index is calculated using the entropy method ( Wang et al.,  2016 ). The evaluation index system is shown in  Table 1 .  3.3. Data collection  This study takes 26 cities in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration (YRD), China, as the study site, and  Fig. 1  indicates the 26 cities  of the YRD. The YRD is one of the regions with the highest levels of  urbanization and economic development, and the largest population of  foreigners. With its powerful economic forces and rapid development,  the YRD has become the sixth largest metropolitan area in the world  ( Chen et al., 2018 ). The YRD is the most mature area for tourism development in China. Because of its rich cultural, historical, natural and  other tourist attractions, it has laid an important foundation for the rapid  development of tourism, which is known as the “Golden Triangle” in the  Chinese tourism industry ( Zhang, Gu, Gu, &amp; Zhang, 2011 ). As of the end  of February 2017, there were 38 scenic spots at the 5A-level in 26 cities  in the YRD, including 3 scenic spots at the 5A-level in Shanghai, 18  scenic spots at the 5A-level in Jiangsu, 12 scenic spots at the 5A-level in  Zhejiang, and 5 scenic spots the 5A-level in Anhui, evidence that tourism  resources are extremely rich and highly complementary. However, there  have also been resource shortages and environmental pollution in the  rapid development of tourism in the YRD, which these have become a  potential danger in the sustainable development of tourism. Therefore,  the YRD is a typical and representative study site.  In 2012, China outlined strategic goals for the “Promotion of ecological civilization”. Taking into account the changes and lags in the  implementation of that policy, and the availability of data, 2011–2016  is selected as the research period. Because the response is often used as  an input indicator for the following year, the four indexes of response  are used from 2010 to 2015. Lastly, the data sources come mainly from  statistical data, such as the China's Statistic Yearbook, China City  Statistical Yearbook, China Tourism Statistics Yearbook and China  Environmental Statistics Yearbook. </div></span>"

Under the two levels of service failure severity, we added a “noresponse” condition to the experimental design for comparison with  alternative response conditions. From a managerial perspective, a  coupon represents the most cost-efficient means of compensating customers among all types of monetary compensation ( Mueller, Palmer,  Mack, &amp; McMullan, 2003 ). The reason is that service providers do not  need to sacrifice any resources unless the customer chooses to use the  coupon for a revisit. This experimental design minimized the inefficient  use of resources and allowed the provision of coupons as monetary  compensation to be examined. Thus, we manipulated the level of  monetary compensation as yes/no instead of high/low ( Mattila &amp;  Cranage, 2005 ;  Mattila &amp; Patterson, 2004 ;  Wirtz &amp; Mattila, 2004 ). In  adherence to the cost-effective principle, the monetary reward was  embodied through a coupon. In addition to being a common form of  compensation through which distributive justice is delivered in service  recovery, coupons are a promotional tool that can boost consumers’  future  purchase  intention  ( Hoffman,  Kelley,  &amp;  Rotalsky,  1995 ;  Kendrick, 1998 ). Hotel operators also largely regard coupons as a  practical, easy-to-allocate reward ( Hocutt &amp; Bowers, 2005 ).  4.1.

The  three key aspects of hotel services covered were the building/bedroom,  furniture/equipment, and services. A three-star hotel was selected in  the scenario because it is most likely to be accepted by the general  public and therefore means the participants are more likely to engage  with the scenarios ( Shanka &amp; Taylor, 2004 ). We used three-star hotel  criteria based on the standards of Expedia and Hotelstars Union for  reference and expectation-setting purposes.  To enhance realism and facilitate participants' engagement, we chose  Orlando as the hotel location in the scenario. Orlando is a popular holiday  destination on the U.S. East Coast ( Gollan, 2015 ). Participants, who were  randomly assigned to one of 10 conditions, were asked to imagine that  they had reported the experienced service failure through an online review  on TripAdvisor. Eight out of the 10 conditions were descriptive accounts of  the service provider's response and recovery effort to the participant's  online review. We manipulated the monetary compensation and speed of  response at different levels through coupon giving (one night's free stay vs.  no coupon) and the timeliness of the recovery process (response within  two days vs. response within two weeks). When there was no reply (two  control conditions), participants were informed that the service provider  did not respond to their online review (for details of three of the 10 stimulated scenarios, see  Appendix B ).  4.2. \n",

For the affective measures, and following  Davies, Rojas-Méndez, Whelan, Mete, and Loo (2018)  we focused on three ‘core’ dimensions of NBP, Warmth (e.g. trustworthy and  friendly), Competence (e.g. skilful and enterprising), and Status (e.g.  sophisticated and elegant). Our measurement items for these and for  tourism intentions were taken from  Rojas-Méndez, Papadopoulos, and  Murphy (2013) . In addition to asking for demographic information,  such as age, gender and education, we included measures of respondent  personality ( Gosling, Rentfrow, &amp; Swann Jr., 2003 ) and attitude towards football ( Beasley &amp; Shank, 1998 ). We also included questions  about frequency of watching football. The second questionnaire (sent  after the event) contained an additional question designed to assess the  valence of news the respondent had read about the World Cup.

Study site  The present study focused on the coasts of the Gulf of Mexico, in the  Mexican states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and  Yucatan and the Mexican Caribbean Sea in the state of Quintana Roo  ( Fig. 2 ). The Mexican Gulf and Caribbean coasts are micro tidal; with  ranges of less than 0.62 m, and wave processes are the primary agents  of morphodynamic changes and sediment transport ( Silva et al., 2008 ).  The climate is semiarid in the northern state of Tamaulipas and humid  subtropical in the other five states.  Historically, the coastal and marine ecosystems on the Gulf of  Mexico and the Caribbean have had high ecological and socioeconomic  value. The biological diversity along these coasts is high, and a rich  array of ecosystems are present, including mangroves, wetlands, seagrass beds, coral reefs, coastal lagoons, coastal dunes, sandy and rocky  beaches ( Martínez et al., 2017 ;  Silva et al., 2014 ). Human activities  such as commercial trade and fishing have taken place along these  coasts for centuries ( Martínez et al., 2017 ;  Propín-Frejomil &amp; SánchezCrispín, 2007 ). In many cases, tourism activities have led to the loss or  degradation of natural ecosystems, negatively affecting the provision of  ecosystem services, such as scenic beauty, recreation and shoreline  protection ( Everard, Jones, &amp; Watts, 2010 ).  2.2. Procedure  We assessed the co-occurrence of coastal tourism and coastal  squeeze as follows ( Fig. 3 ). First, we located all the tourist destinations  in the study area and assessed the intensity of tourism activities in terms  of infrastructure (hotels). This was a proxy of urbanization. Second,  coastal squeeze was assessed by using intersections among the cartographic representations of three parameters: the need for ecosystems to  migrate inland, the actual possibility of inland migration and the longterm coastal sustainability of urban development in terms of flood risk  ( Table 1 ). The calculations for all the variables are described below.  2.2.1. Tourism intensity  Tourist sites on a 10-km-wide coastal belt were geo-localized for  each state. Five categories were selected for each littoral cell ( Table 1 ),  from no tourism to high intensity tourism. A low number of hotels does  not necessarily reflect a low capacity of tourist accommodation or low  tourism pressure because a single hotel may have many rooms. So, the  number of hotel rooms was also considered, as massive all-inclusive  resorts have proliferated along the Mexican Caribbean coast. Thus, a  new data layer from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography  (INEGI) showing the number of rooms per location was overlaid on the  tourism destinations studied. Those sites labeled as low tourism (with a  reduced number of hotels) but with more than one thousand rooms  were re-labeled as medium intensity category.  2.2.2. Coastal squeeze  Coastal squeeze was determined with a \n",

              "-based model. Three  parameters reflecting the probability of coastal squeeze were selected:  the need for ecosystems to migrate inland, the actual possibility of inland migration, and the long-term coastal sustainability (flood risk)  ( Table 1 ).  a) Need to migrate  The need of ecosystems to migrate inland depends on different local  attributes of the coast: a decreased resistance to disturbance owing to  fragmentation; a decreased resilience, which is indirectly determined  by an erosion threshold, and the capacity of protection provided by  natural ecosystems. It was calculated based on the estimated impact of  disturbance variables (flood risk, erosion, and storms) that could force  ecosystems to migrate inland. When assessing the need to migrate we  considered coastal resistance and resilience as follows.  Decreased resistance Resistance was considered as the capacity of  an ecosystem to deal with perturbations (remain unchanged) and was  determined according to the geological and ecological attributes of  coastal ecosystems ( Liquete et al., 2013 ). Coastal resistance was considered as a measure of the state of conservation of an ecosystem, assuming that a decline in vegetation cover can affect the capacity to trap  sediments and increase sand erosion ( Pontee, 2013 ). Fragmentation  was therefore considered to reflect a decrease in ecosystem resistance.  Maps of the occurrence and degree of perturbation of mangrove and  coastal  dune  ecosystems  from  previous  works  were  considered  ( CONABIO 2016 ;  Martínez et al., 2014b , p. 350). Both diagnostics were  national maps produced using high-resolution remote sensing data, field work and aerial photographs. We focused on coastal ecosystems  (mangroves and coastal dunes) and created maps with their conservation status, based on information previously generated, as explained  below.  2.2.3. Mangrove perturbation  In the Mexican Atlas of mangroves ( CONABIO, 2016 ) it is estimated  that this ecosystem covers a total area of 770,057 ha, in a 1:50,000  scale. The perturbation map of the Atlas was produced mainly from  multispectral images of the SPOT-5 satellite (10 m spatial resolution)  from 2015. Then, digital elevation models (2015), vegetation indexes  and field data were used to classify the images. Finally, the map was  validated through an extensive field campaign and helicopter over- flights by the Secretary of Mexican Marine Defense, always accompanied by experts on mangrove vegetation. The country was divided in five regions (Gulf of Mexico, Yucatan Peninsula, Northern Pacific,  Central Pacific and South Pacific) and nine classes (anthropic development, crop and animal husbandry, other vegetation types, unvegetated, mangrove, disturbed mangrove, other wetlands, water  bodies, other). To achieve the goals of this study, two regions were  selected (Gulf of Mexico and Yucatan Peninsula) and two land use  classes (mangrove and perturbed mangrove). The layer of perturbed  mangrove was overlapped with a map of infrastructure. The final three  classes ranged from conserved mangroves to highly perturbed areas  ( Table 1 ).  2.2.4. Coastal dunes perturbation  Martínez et al. (2014b)  performed a national diagnostic of Mexican  coastal dunes. Google Earth images were used to digitalize and classify  coastal dunes. First, the authors regionalized Mexican coasts into five  areas (North Pacific, Gulf of California, South Pacific, Gulf of Mexico  and Yucatan Peninsula). Then, coastal dune systems were digitized, and  the conservation status of each system was determined according to  land use, inhabited areas (from villages to cities), density of roads and  highways, as well as all the elements that may cause dune fragmentation (a description of the five levels of conservation status is shown in  Table 1 ).  Decreased resilience .  In this study, resilience was defined as the  capacity of ecosystems to respond to disturbances and retain the essential structures, processes, and feedbacks ( Martínez et al., 2017 ).  When ecosystems are resilient, the adaptive capacity of society to the  increasing risk from natural hazards is increased ( Jones, Hole, &amp;  Zavaleta, 2012 ;  Reid, 2016 ). Because sediment dynamics play a key role  in the natural dynamics of coastal ecosystems, we measured resilience  in terms of changes in the sediment erosion threshold, based on  revious studies.  2.2.5. Changes in sediment erosion threshold  This variable refers to changes in sediment erosion threshold owing  to the impact of badly-planned infrastructure on the natural hydrosedimentary dynamics of the coast.  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares  (2004)  used multi-temporal information from satellite images (LIDAR  1986 to 2013) and field verification to classify Mexican coasts according to their geodynamic behavior and vulnerability to erosion. The  authors defined the instability tendency of the Mexican coastline as a  function of internal geodynamic processes (tectonic characteristics,  vertical movements of ground) and external geodynamic processes  (hydrological and hydrographic characteristics of the fluvial and estuarine network). Then,  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares (2004)  proposed a \n",

              " of Mexico ( Silva et al., 2014 )  includes the velocity of coastal changes and considers five categories in  response to natural and artificial drivers: slowly prograding, rapidly  prograding, stable, slowly erosive, and very erosive ( Table 1 ). We thus  used the velocity of coastal changes (slow, none, fast) as a measure of  resilience: faster changes were assumed to represent a reduced resilience. Obviously, when shoreline evolution is negative (erosion), it is  hazardous for human infrastructure.  2.2.6. Natural protective capacity  Natural coastal ecosystems attenuate waves in normal conditions  and during storm events, reduce storm surge waves and promote sediment deposition and retention. In consequence, coastal ecosystems  help to protect the coasts from flooding and erosion. The effectiveness  of such protection depends on coastal geomorphology and the type of  ecosystem (depending on physical attributes such as the surface  roughness or the frictional resistance, related with the degree of conservation, the size of the ecosystem, the vegetation density and stiffness).  Coastal geomorphology: The occurrence of erosion and flooding  largely depends on coastal geomorphology. This information was  gathered from topographic and geological maps by  Silva et al. (2014) .  The natural protective capacity of each geomorphological type found  on the coast was classified following  Liquete et al. (2013)  which was  modified to better fit our study sites ( Table 1 ).  Coastal habitat resistance: This variable reflects the physical resistance of each coastal ecosystem to any potential environmental  change in sediment or wave energy dynamics (e.g. waves during actual  and future storm events) attributed to its ecological attributes. We  classified the Coastal habitat resistance according to the frequency and  level of exposure to energy (wave and flooding) under prevailing and  extreme conditions. In addition, the condition of the fragility of each  ecosystem was considered to generate the ranking in resistance  ( Table 1 ).  b) Migration possibility  Migration possibility was assessed based on the premise that coastal  ecosystems can migrate inland when they are well preserved and  functional, and there are no physical obstacles (natural or human-induced) that interrupt such processes. In consequence, we considered  that the inland migration of an ecosystem depends on the type of coast  (with cliffs totally blocking any inland migration) and is negatively  affected by coastal infrastructure and urban growth. Therefore, the  variables used for this assessment included type of coastline (see  Table 1 ) ( Silva et al., 2011 ) and the occurrence of rigid barriers that  could either directly block migration or disrupt hydro-sedimentary  dynamics and increase erosion ( Rangel-Buitrago, Williams, &amp; Anfuso,  2018 ).  Type of coast was used as a proxy of migration capacity based on the  theory of environmental filtering, which states that environmental  stress factors (sand movement, soil salinity, etc.) are filters that determine the presence of tolerant or non-tolerant species in a specific  site, given the predominant environmental conditions. These species  are gathered, according to their tolerances, into functional traits that  are useful to predict community behavior and possible responses to  changes ( Gallego-Fernández &amp; Martínez, 2011 ). It was thus assumed  that plants growing on naturally erosive beaches are usually adapted to  salinity and burial by sand and can even be dispersed by sea-water.  Hence, it is expected that these plants will have a high natural capacity  for landward migration as the salinity increases inland owing to SLR. In  turn, when the beach is eroding artificially and rapidly, non-tolerant  and mainly inland species are present, and the possibility of migration  is reduced.  For each sedimentary cell, and from the shoreline up to 100 m inland, image analyses using Arc Map 10.2 was used to map the occurrence of coastal infrastructure (rigid barriers, perpendicular to the  shoreline or located on the waterfront), considering their spatial location, number, and type (breakwaters, groins, and ports). Finally, the  degree of rigidity of each sedimentary cell was estimated by combining  the type of coast and the occurrence of coastal infrastructure on the  beach, on top of, or behind the dune systems, according to  Pranzini  et al. (2015) .  c) Long-term sustainability (Flood risk and SLR)  The long-term sustainability of a coastal site is largely affected by  sea level rise and flood risk (caused by heavy rains and storm surges).  The location of such flood-prone areas was based on previous work by  Ortiz-Pérez and Méndez-Linares (2004) , who performed a geomorphological analysis of the Mexican coasts. First, they divided the coasts  of Mexico into geomorphic units, and then they performed a coastal  zonation with aerial imagery (1943, 1975, 1986 and 1997), a videography,  ∼ 1 m ground resolution (1997), and topographic maps (1:  10,000) from the National Institute of Statistics and Geography (INEGI)  and terrain data from ground surveys. The zoning was based on variables that considered internal geodynamic processes (tectonics and  subsidence; local subsidence), external geodynamic processes (historical shoreline variations), hydrometeorological factors (mean significant wave height), and vegetation zones. The authors assumed that  belts of different vegetation types (e.g. herbaceous wetland, mangrove,  etc.) result from differences in flooding tolerance and hence, flood  permanence. Maps showing the vulnerability to fluvial and coastal flooding were generated by combining the above-mentioned geomorphological zoning with slope, elevation and historical flooding events  (by storm surges and surface runoff). The flood vulnerability was  completed by including low-lying lands that are normally dry, but  which had been flooded in the past by either seawater or surface runoff.  Finally, we uploaded all the information in a \n",

              "-based model with  which the map of potentially inundated areas exposed to 1 m of SLR  was generated. To achieve this, we combined the coastal zoning of flood-prone areas with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) following the  same methods as  Villatoro et al. (2014) . The coastal flooding map that  we used combined both sea level rise and flood risk (caused by heavy  rains and storm surges).  To characterize the probability of flooding by storm surge for the  states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, Yucatan and  Quintana Roo,  Arriaga, Durán, Posada, Silva, and de Brye (2010) , used  the hybrid model Mato-HURAC ( Posada, Silva, &amp; de Brye, 2008 ) and  the database of the Atlantic Mexican Atlas of maritime climate ( Silva  et al., 2008 ) modeled numerically the 117 hurricanes that arrived at the  Mexican coasts between 1949 and 2009.  Following  Villatoro et al. (2014) , for all the entire Mexican Atlantic  coast we obtained the maximum storm surge per year. Flood-prone  areas were delineated based on estimated storm surge and using the  same method  Villatoro et al. (2014)  used in which the authors explored  the vulnerability to flooding and erosion using a range of variables  (topography, bathymetry, climate) in the model projections and risk  analysis tools. The data thus obtained was ordered annually from  highest to lowest and a Weibull type probability adjustment was used.  For the present study, the data corresponding to a storm surge with a  100-year probability of occurrence were used.  2.3.

Methods  Current literature on cross-cultural tour groups inclines towards  positivist or post-positivist paradigms ( Kwek &amp; Lee, 2010 ;  Wang &amp;  Davidson, 2010a ,  2010b ;  Wang, Weaver, et al., 2016 ) informed by a  priori principles lacking su ffi cient context to capture the complex attendant cultural dynamics. Alternatively, a social constructivist paradigm can capture the latter by de-emphasizing researcher assumptions  about such lived experiences and through recognition of duality and  subjectivity allowing for the construction, deconstruction, and reconstruction of meaning ( Jennings, 2010 ). Lived experiences allow us  to develop insider perspectives by providing vivid and descriptive accounts of those who live the experience. We were thus able to better  interpret these experiences and gain meaningful understanding of the  phenomenon ( Mapp, 2008 ;  Pernecky &amp; Jamal, 2010 ). Such an interpretive approach permits identification and understanding of decisionmaking processes and lived experiences of tour group members in a  Western or non-Western context ( Phillmore &amp; Goodson, 2004 ).  Recent studies of face in tourism embody the importance of immersive qualitative approaches, due to their explanatory power and  proximity to informants ( Kwek &amp; Lee, 2013 ;  2015 ).

              " through constant construct refinements and  cross-comparisons.  Consequently, two of the three researchers (Fieldwork researchers 1  and 2, or FR1 and FR2) participated in tour groups to China for overseas  Chinese. To triangulate this case, they initially participated in different  tours (A &amp; B) then participated in two tours together (C &amp; D), over a  four year period from 2011 to 2015. Through integration into these  tours where they conducted independent observations, an emic perspective was gained. FR1 participated in a nine-day Beijing-Shanghai  overland tour (A) involving 26 residents of Australia and Indonesia of  Chinese ethnicity. FR2 participated in Tour B, an eight-day tour focused  on Beijing with 33 participants mostly China- or Taiwan-born but  currently resident overseas (i.e. Australia, Canada, New Zealand or  United States). Tour C had a similar itinerary to Tour A, but with a  different membership profile consisting of 37 Chinese participants from  Western and Southeast Asian countries. Tour D was a regional tour  covering Shanghai and several surrounding cities, with 17 participants  rimarily from Mainland China and currently residing in Australia and  Canada. These samples conveniently captured diasporic Chinese of  varying Chinese language proficiency and cultural understanding from  key geographic locations (see  Appendix 1 ). Priced below operational  costs, all tours recuperated costs though exposure to intensive shopping  at designated venues ( Wang et al., 2016 ). This context was crucial to  interpreting observed behavior, as participants and intermediaries were  pressured, respectively, to buy and sell featured products.  The researchers used covert observations owing to negative publicity of low cost tours, wherein disclosure may incite abuses from  implicated tour operators. We observed tourist interactions with each  other and service intermediaries, as well as associated spatial, temporal  and social contexts. While not possible to observe all such interactions  at all times, the two participant-researchers maintained an attitude of  continual alertness, and were especially vigilant during times of group  congregation such as at target attractions, on the tour bus, and during  meals. Casual conversations with individuals or small groups were also  initiated at opportune times, as warranted, to obtain clarity on observed  dynamics. Covertness, while by necessity imposing a power imbalance  between observer and observed, was considered necessary as the phenomenon is public but provides participant anonymity ( Holloway,  Brown, &amp; Shipway, 2010 ). Covert observations in other settings such as  nude beaches ( Andriotis, 2010 ), premarital stag tours ( Thurnell-Read,  2012 ), and children's shelters ( Tomozos &amp; Butler, 2012 ) have been similarly justified. By concealing our identities, we could immerse ourselves without influencing participant behavior. Partially redressing the  issue of power imbalance, tour group members were notified of our  identity as university researchers and when questioned, we divulged  our academic interest in Chinese group tours without revealing any  specificity of interest. We could thus detect participant motivations and  observe relevant interactions while complying with university's ethics  protocol as well as government legislation. Both fieldwork researchers  kept a diary for each tour in which they participated, and entries were  made at the end of each day of the tours.  To better understand our interpretations, disclosure of researcher(s)  contexts is necessary ( Caelli, Ray, &amp; Mill, 2008 ). Being ethnic Chinese,  both fieldwork researchers were able to play an  ‘ insider ’  role to allow  for better in-depth \n",

              " due to their cultural proximity  to the observed phenomenon ( Chang (2009) ). FR1 arrived in Australia  from Singapore in 1998. Her research expertise is drawn from her industrial and academic careers focusing on Chinese tourism. Being of  Chinese heritage with a Westernised education assists her in understanding both her current and original cultures. FR2 is familiar with  both Chinese and Western cultures, as she grew up in Mainland China,  studied in the United Kingdom, and migrated to Australia in 2001. Both  relied on their cultural heritage and anticipated varying levels of  facework in the tours, as subsequently established. Researcher 3, of  European heritage who migrated to Australia from Canada, guided the  theoretical and analytical phases of this research. All three researchers  have resided in Australia for an extended period of time and hence  acknowledge that their interpretations may be contaminated by Eurocentric Australian values.  Data were compiled in six detailed travel diaries (i.e., the three  tours undertaken by each of the two participant-researchers) with relevant observations and self-reflections supplemented by unstructured fieldwork conversations involving almost all other tour group members,  allowing for comprehensive exploration of attendant cultural practice  and values ( Silverman, 2001 ). We sought information on participants'  background (e.g., birth place, trip purpose and frequency, resident  country, and views on face) through casual conversations. This is crucial to our reflexivity, especially when a priori assumptions exist  ( Anderson, 2006 ;  Tribe, Xiao, &amp; Chambers, 2012 ;  Tribe &amp; Xiao, 2011 ).  Reflexivity guides theory development by extending existing theory  with the incorporation of new findings. Authenticity and credibility  were strengthened through observations by two fieldwork researchers  across four tour groups/six observed experiences ( DeBerry-Spence,  2010 ). Limitations of our observations are: (i) likely prioritization of  participants ’  perception at the expense of self-understanding, (ii) potentially missing of ambiguous but meaningful events by prioritizing  persistently occurring events and, (iii) compromising critical analysis  when developing personal relationships with participants ( Drew,  Hardman, &amp; Hart, 1996 ). Consequently, we practiced continual selfreflection, member-checking and cross-checking to minimize these  limitations ( Jennings, 2010 ).  Data interpretation proceeded through \n",

              ", which  allows continual clarification of emerging themes and supports crossanalytical validation. Ultimately, a verdict of theoretical saturation  resulted once no new insights emerged; additional data, however, aided  in expanding the details of these revealed themes. For ethical reasons,  pseudonyms were used in result reporting. Moreover, tour group  members under 18 were excluded as they were travelling with their  parents and as such may have been shielded from facework participation or consequences, create an issue of parental consent that is not well  addressed in \n",

It is an effective approach for systematic interpretation of  qualitative data with a purpose of theory generation, highly suitable for  constructivist approaches ( Corbin &amp; Strauss, 2008 ). For example, we  identified in the open codes how members within groups exert pressure  on others to purchase souvenirs in order to deflect their own pressure  (please see Section  4.2 , Quadrant 4 for the context of this specific exchange). This exchange was deduced into a set of axial codes as shown  in  Fig. 2 . These codes reflect the within-group and public nature of the  attack and resulting loss of the attacker's face ( Lian ). Similarly, our  second example illustrates a case of reciprocal attack in public which  results in loss of face ( Lian  and  Mianzi ) for both parties involved (see  Section  4.1 , Quadrant 6).

The new technology  integrates several systems, including property management, central  reservation, sales management, reward systems management, and  communication.

Samples  The traditional face-to-face and voice-to-voice contact between  employees and guests is changing. In today's workplace, many hotels  use automation technologies, such as self-service check-in kiosks and  mobile service requests, to minimize costs and maximize operations  efficiencies.  This  study was conducted  among luxury hotels in  Guangzhou, China, a major international metropolis and innovative  South China city. Guangzhou has become an international science and  technology innovation hub. Many hotels in this global city are taking  advanced technologies to a new level by introducing robots into guest  service roles. Accordingly, hotel employees in Guangzhou are subjected  to advanced technology pressures. Thus, Guangzhou luxury hotel employees were selected as the research participants. To generate samples,  one of the authors contacted human resources (HR) managers at 35  hotels from a list provided by the local tourism administration office to  seek their approval to participate in this study. A total of 12 hotel HR  managers agreed to participate in this study. These 12 properties were  all five-star rated ‘luxury’ hotels, offering the opportunity to \n",

A team of research assistants distributed surveys at random to employees beginning their work shifts once written permission was obtained from the top management of all hotel properties. A total of 550  questionnaires were distributed among these 12 hotels with ten properties receiving 46 surveys and two properties receiving 45 surveys. A  total of 468 valid, and useable responses were returned from these 12  hotel properties. The duty roster for each hotel as reported by the  human resource staff determined that about 80% of all total employees  at all 12 properties worked primarily in three departments representing  Food and Beverage, Housekeeping and the Front Office. Thus, 80 percent of the surveys, or 37 surveys out of 46 for the 10 hotel properties,  and 36 out of 45 surveys for the two other hotel properties were distributed to employees working in those three departments at random  during a one-week period in early 2018. The remaining 8 or 9 surveys  for each property were distributed at random to employees in various  other departments including engineering, maintenance, security, spa  and fitness following the same procedure. Because social desirability  bias could possibly affect the validity of the questionnaire since this  study attempted to collect socially sensitive data, participants were  required to return their completed questionnaires by ballot boxes to  further guarantee their anonymity. Results from this effort showed that  nearly 42 percent of those participants had at least a four-year university degree. The average age of all respondents was 31.2 years and  61.6 percent of all respondents held non-management jobs. Women  represented 52 percent of all respondents.

AI and robotics awareness.  Four items were taken and modified from  Brougham and Haar (2017) 's study to better align them within the  context of hotels. All AI and robotics awareness items were measured  using seven-point Likert scales ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7  (strongly agree). Sample items included: “I think my job has a high risk  of bowing to automation and will be replaced by machines with AI” and  “I am quite pessimistic about my future in this hotel due to employees  ossibly being replaced by an artificial intelligence system”.  Perceived organizational  support. Eight items were adapted from  prior studies ( Eisenberger, Huntington, Hutchison, &amp; Sowa, 1986 ) and  modified to fit the study's hotel context. POS was measured using a  seven-point Likert-type scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to  strongly agree (7). Sample items included: “Our hotel cares about the  voice of employees,” “Our hotel genuinely cares about each individual's  well-being,” and “I can get immediate assistance if I need it”.

For example, respondents were asked if they agreed that “I think it might be  time to seriously consider quitting”, or on the contrary, “I will not leave  my current position”.  3.3. Analyses  This study investigated cross-level relationships with POS and CPC  at the hotel level and AI and robotics awareness and turnover intentions  at the employee level. However, because there are methodological and  conceptual weaknesses for both analyses, hierarchical linear modeling  (HLM) was used to remedy the methodological biases and limitations.  As an example, using the individual level analysis with the disaggregation method could provide a biased estimate of standard errors,  whereas the statistical testing power could be seriously weakened by  using the aggregation method within the organizational level. Thus,  hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) software version 7.01 was used to  analyze this unique nature of the multilevel data.  3.4. Data aggregation  A two-level model was identified using an outcome variable to represent turnover intentions and two independent variables were used at  the hotel-level to represent the POS and CPC. The direct consensus  model was performed to assess POS and CPC; that is, to estimate the  within-group agreement in the employee's POS and CPC for each hotel  by aggregating the lower-level units to higher level variables. To justify  the suitability of aggregating POS and CPC at the hotel level, both γ and intra-class correlations (ICCs) were calculated. The γ  were 0.90  for POS and 0.83 for CPC, which were well above the recommended  threshold value of 0.7. Thus, the results do support the underlying assumption that employees within hotels generally agreed on their POS  and CPC. In addition, the \n",

Method  The methodology used to analyze the extent to which two contrasting categories of rate parity related legislative events (the first  category of events consists of the passing of rate parity bans in multiple  European countries, and the second being the dismissal of the rate  parity lawsuit in the United States) might have an impact on the market  value of the hotel and OTA industries involves several steps, based on  McWilliams and Siegel (1997) .  The abnormal returns are estimated through an event study. Under  the tenets of the E ffi cient Market Hypothesis, given available information, stock returns fully reflect all information affecting a firm,  including expectations about anticipated performance. In other words,  the methodology incorporates investors ’  valuation of discounted future  economic flows. Because market value is determined by stock prices,  this widely accepted view holds that when new firm relevant information arises, it results in changes in market value of firms - or the  market value of the industry, when the multiple firms in the industry  are impacted. Regulatory shocks in the two-sided hotel booking market,  including the rate parity related legislative outcomes that we are interested in assessing should therefore manifest themselves in the form  of abnormal returns for the OTA and hotel industries, respectively.  This choice of methodology has several benefits compared to accounting based measures of performance (such as profits). Firstly, we  are better able to isolate effects than we would with backward-looking  accounting metrics. Also, stock returns are not as influenced by seasonality issues as accounting measures ( Nicolau &amp; Sharma, 2019 ). In  addition, because stock returns reflect the discounted value of all future  economic flows and relevant information affecting, they serve as an  excellent estimate of true performance ( McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997 ).  To be specific, the event study methodology follows different steps  to collect the data ( McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997 ):  i)  Detection of the event dates and sample selection.  In this analysis, we  use two sets of event dates, one for the European case and the other  for the US case. The first set of event dates (consisting of dates  when rate parity bans were passed in Europe ) are therefore: January 9th, 2015 (Germany); July 9th, 2015 (France); December 9th,  2016 (Austria); August 2nd, 2017 (Italy); July 19th, 2018 (Belgium); and July 20th, 2018 (Sweden). All these dates mark the dates  when the legislations were passed in the European countries, even if  the legislation was to come into effect at a later date in each country.  However, because the methodology used here is a forward-looking  measure based on investor valuation of future economic costs and  benefits, one would expect that even if the actual law were to come  into effect at a later date, changes in market value would be best  reflected when the legislation was passed. Certainly, this would not  be the case when using accounting based performance metrics such  as profits, where it would be important to examine effects only after  the laws came into effect.  It is important to recall that  Nicolau and Sharma (2019)  have already studied the impact of European rate parity bans on hotels; consequently, for the European case, we focus not on the effects on hotels,  but on the effects on OTAs. The dataset of OTAs for which we assess  changes in market value resulting from the passing of these legislations  consists of the major global publicly traded OTAs: Booking Holdings  Inc., Priceline Group Inc., Expedia Group Inc., Trivago N.V., Tripadvisor, Liberty Expedia Holdings and CTrip.  The other event date consists of the date the rate parity lawsuit was  dismissed in the United States  –  February 18, 2014. For this event, we  examine both the effect on the previously listed major publicly traded  global OTAs as well as on all major hotels listed on U.S. exchanges  under the Standard Industrial \n",

              " (SIC) system in the Center  for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) database. The obtained publicly  traded hotel firms with useable data were assumed to constitute the  U.S. hotel industry for purposes of examining effects of the U.S. rate  parity lawsuit dismissal.  Because there is a high frequency of merger and acquisition activity  in the OTA industry, the actual list of OTAs was not identical for the set  of events that consist of the dates when the European countries passed  legislation banning rate parity. However, because we are interested in  making industry level conclusions rather than conclusions about individual firms, the differences in list of OTAs from event-to-event are  not of concern. There is of course a high frequency of merger and acquisition activity in the hotel industry too, but because hotel reactions  in the present study involve a single date  –  the U.S. dismissal of the rate  parity lawsuit  –  the mergers and acquisitions in the hotel industry are  not relevant.  ii)  Definition of the event window.  As new information might not be  obtained by all shareholders at the same time, we select a 7-day  event window to test for any excess returns i.e., the three days before and after ( − 3,+3) the announcement date. Shorter windows  are preferred because they are less likely to be contaminated by  confounding events ( McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997 ). Additional abnormal returns may be detected with longer windows, however, we  would not be able to attribute with confidence those abnormal returns to the event(s) we are interested in assessing.  Indeed, it is also customary practice in the event study literature  ( MacKinlay, 1997 ;  McWilliams &amp; Siegel, 1997 ) to allow for the possibility that the market may acquire some information prior to an announcement, and have some expectation regarding the event. If this  were indeed to happen, then the market is likely to react prior to the  actual announcement. When dealing with regulatory events such as  this, a reaction prior to the actual announcement may occur for instance  because investors have an understanding of the economic policy  “ tendency ”  of the government. In the European cases note also that the rate  parity bans were not simultaneously passed in all countries. As such, by  simply having observed the prior legal outcomes in other European  countries, investors might be able to predict the position an imminent  announcement might take. We therefore include in the event window a  small numbers of days leading up to each event.  iii)  Identification of potential confounding effects.  The third step tries to  identify other news items -not related to the rate parity news-that  might appear in the event window and that could have a confounding effect on the potential abnormal returns. In order to find  any possible confounding effects, we queried Dow Jones' Factiva  database which covers over 32,000 news sources for the 7-day  period that comprises each event window. Typically, in a study such  as this, confounding news items on event dates would result in the  exclusion of firms for those particular dates. However, given that no  relevant news publications are detected in the event windows that  we have used, the firms listed in step one are maintained.  iv)  Estimation of the market model . The estimation of the market model  allows us to calculate the  “ normal returns ” , so a period of 150 days  is established for such estimation. Estimates are made based on the  market model, defined as  where for firm  i  on day  t ,  R  defines the daily returns and  R  defines  market portfolio's returns based on the Center for Research in Security  Prices' (CRSP) value weighted index, which covers the NYSE, NYSE  American, NASDAQ, and ARCA exchanges.

The upper upscale full-service hotels were 97 with 944  observations and the upper upscale limited-service hotels were 15 with  46 observations. The upscale full-service hotels were 61 with 564 observations and the upscale limited-service hotels were 68 with 566  observations. The midscale limited-service hotels were 30 with 299  observations and the economy limited-service hotels were 92 with 920  observations (see  Fig. 1  &amp;  Table 2 ).  3.2. Variables and models  There were five dependent variables in the models, which were  occupancy ((the number of rooms sold/the number of total available  rooms) x 100), average daily rate (ADR = total room revenue/the  number of rooms sold), revenue per available room (RevPAR = total  room revenue/the number of total available rooms), gross operating  profit per available room (GOPPAR = (total room revenue – total room  expense)/the number of total available rooms), and gross operating  profit (GOP = ((total room revenue – total room expense)/the room  revenue). After testing normality of distribution, this study used the  natural log of the variables: LogOccupancy [log (the number of rooms  sold/the number of total available rooms) x 100], LogADR [log (total  room revenue/the number of rooms sold)], LogRevPAR [log (total room  revenue/the number of total available rooms)], LogGOPPAR [log (total  room revenue – total room expense)/the number of total available  rooms], and GOP ratio [((total room revenue – total room expense)/the  room revenue)]. The independent variable was the proportion of F&amp;B  employees' salary over rooms employees’ salary after logarization: Log  (F&amp;B Salary/Room Salary). This study chose the comparative ratio of  employee salary between the F&amp;B department and the rooms department because the labor cost was the most significant input for the F&amp;B  department. For the control variables, LogADR (when a dependent  variable was LogOccupancy) or LogOccupancy (when a dependent  variable was LogADR), class (luxury, upper upscale, upscale, upper  midscale, midscale and economy), location of hotels (urban, suburban,  and others), years of operation (Age), hotel size (largest, upper large,  large, upper middle, middle, and small based on the number of rooms),  administrative and general expense (Log (A&amp;G/Total Revenue)), marketing expense (Log (Marketing/Total Revenue)), and year dummies  were included in the models. Here, class and hotel size were ordered  variables, which were treated as continuous variables but location was  a categorical variable with other areas as a base.  A random-effects regression was used because the models included  important time invariant variables, including location, the class of hotel  and the size hotel. The models were to examine how important the F&amp;B  operating was in hotel business performance in the aspect of occupancy,  ADR, RevPAR, GOPPAR, and GOP ratio.

Moreover, to address whether residents' perceptions and attitudes  regarding the event and their overall QOL has changed as a function of  time, series of simple t-tests were performed on each of the means of  latent variables between the near- and distant-past samples. Finally, to  examine the proposed variations in residents’ construct abstraction  regarding the evaluation of event impacts and overall life quality over  time, a multi-group analysis was conducted to test the structural invariance of paths in the proposed model between the near- and distant-past groups. Specifically, by constraining the hypothesized paths  among two groups to be equal, a series of multi-group modeling were  erformed. Using the baseline model which had no equality constrain  across groups as the reference, a Satorra-Bentler scaled chi-square  difference test was then conducted to assess the differences between  each path between two groups. </div></span>"

              " Cricket World Cup  The West Indies, also referred to as the Caribbean, is a crescentshaped archipelago that separates the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean  Sea to the west and south respectively, from the Atlantic Ocean to the  east and north. The chain of islands stretches from the peninsula of  Florida southeast to the north coast of Venezuela.  After a competitive bidding process, nine Caribbean countries were  selected to jointly host the event. The host countries were Antigua and  Barbuda, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Kitts and Nevis, St.  Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. The  small size of the islands necessitated this co-hosting arrangement across  multiple island-states as no one island had the capacity, human and  otherwise, to deliver the entire event.  Importantly, Caribbean cricket is more than merely sport ( Beckles,  2004 ). Cricket in the Caribbean is believed to reflect “both the region's  colonial history and its post-colonial aspirations” ( Horne, 2010 , p.  1555) and is “most obviously touched by elements of carnival” ( Crabbe  &amp; Wagg, 2000 , p. 70).

In  preparation for the event, all nine host countries made significant investments. However, Barbados and Jamaica allocated the largest  amount of funds to host the event. The monies earmarked for the largescale event project represented significant portions of each nation's  national budget. The Government of Barbados allocated US$200 million of its budget, while the Government of Jamaica allocated US$105  million of taxpayers' money to host the event ( Bhagoo &amp; Rambarran,  2006 ).

To improve the  representation of China, we also selected residents from Qingdao,  Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming and Xi'an, in regions in the northern, central and western parts of the country. Moreover, the respondents had  participated in gaming to various degrees; and they had visited at least  a gaming destination (e.g., Macau) before. It is desirable to choose  experienced participants who had exposure to the research context (i.e.,  gaming), as inexperienced ones would not able to contribute to the  subject matter ( Siggelkow, 2007 ). Experienced participants may provide both subjective and objective meanings and definitions about their  attitude towards gaming, including situated meanings and systematic  divergences in meanings. This approach allows us to understand reality  construction in reference to the relationship of framing and gaming  legitimacy ( Gephart &amp; Robert, 2004 ). Their understandings, perceptions or behaviors were used to determine if a meaning of legitimacy  could emerge. Thus this sample matched the fact that current literature  has explained different framing processes from various types of samples. Second, we followed a \n",

We chose Chinese to study their gaming experience towards their perception of and behavior concerning legitimacy because extant theorizing of framing and gaming legitimacy focuses predominantly on  Western contexts ( Humphreys &amp; Latour, 2013 ). Through personal  contacts, we approached interviewees to collect the in-depth information which informants were reluctant to share with the unfamiliar interviewer, a known factor to consider in the Chinese culture. A total of  37 interviews were conducted; and some of the informants were interviewed more than twice in order to provide follow-up information  and quality feedback. The interviews typically lasted from 1 to 1.5 h.  The data collection process took approximately three weeks and concluded when no new information could be obtained. The interviewees'  profiles are presented in  Table 1 . Approximately equal numbers of  males and females from different age groups were selected. Some respondents were from the lower-income group, such as factory workers  and salesmen, whereas other participants had middle-class occupations,  such as a doctor, an engineer, and a small-business owner.  In order to explore informants' naturalistic interpretations of the  “frame” in their own expression, we did not provide any definition  about the framing process of gaming legitimacy development. Initial  questions were asked: “How do you like gambling?” and “Who do you  gamble with?” Once we grasped informants’ general understandings of  framing related to gaming, we proceeded with more in-depth questions  germane to their views on gaming development, as described below.  Thematic questions were asked to develop insights into how the gaming  industry is viewed by residents, including its positive and negative  impacts. The primary questions that framed the interviews included,  “What do you think about the gaming industry in China?” “Why do you  support/not support the gaming industry?” “If China further develops  the gaming industry, what is your attitude?”  Each \n",

Selection of a  suitable host destination was informed by four criteria to promote  sample representativeness and the practical significance of findings.  The host destination had to (1) be a major world class destination for  international travellers, (2) include substantial numbers of long-stay  travellers, (3) provide substantive intercultural differences between  host and tourist and (4) provide achievable means of data collection.  Accordingly, Phuket, Thailand was selected as a data collection site  owing to its popularity among international travellers. Indeed, senior  international travellers from diverse cultures make up approximately  35% of the tourists visiting Thailand annually ( Department of Tourism,  2016 ). Phuket is among the top three tourist destinations of Thailand  and is the country's most visited beach destination ( Tourism Authority  of Thailand, 2013 ). Phuket is a preferred destination for long-haul  travellers from Scandinavia, the UK, and Europe, especially for longstay winter holidays, as well as Australians. International tourist arrivals to Phuket have been increasing and reached approximately 13  million in 2016 ( Department of Tourism, 2017 ).

All informants were recruited during the day time on varying  days of the week, over an extended period of 3 months. Hence, the  scope of data collection allowed for the capture of core visitors to a  beach destination and minimised sampling bias. As the traveller profile  in Phuket more often involved tourists travelling in pairs it was decided  to conduct both individual interviews and dyadic interviews, as appropriate. The set of interviews consisted of 22 interviews of individuals  and 11 interviews of couples.  2.2. Dyadic interviews  While dyadic interviewing is rare in tourism research, the technique  has a number of strengths that suggest it is highly suitable for exploring  tourist behaviour. Its main strength lies in the fact that much tourist  behaviour reflects shared experiences as a couple or group. Travel with  a friend or partner involves multiple joint activities at the host destination, in contrast to home behaviour where shopping, cafes, walking,  fitness, markets, entertainment or hobbies are often individualised.  Dyadic interviewing is an interdependent methodology that accommodates the key assumption of syncratic consumption underlying  joint travel. Dyadic interviewing or joint interviewing involves two  informants and an interviewer interacting concurrently. Hence, the  \n",

Hilton's  “ Travel with a  purpose ”  includes initiatives focused on sustainable travel and tourism,  providing opportunities for young people and funding projects that  support local communities ( Hilton, 2019 ). Studies have identified numerous positive impacts of CSR strategies for tourism accommodation  providers, including increasing consumer trust, customer satisfaction,  brand preference, identification with the company, consumer loyalty,  corporate and brand reputation and purchase intention ( Gao &amp; Mattila,  2014 ;  Liu, Wong, Shi, Chu, &amp; Brock, 2014 ;  Martínez &amp; Bosque, 2013 ;  Su, Swanson, &amp; Chen, 2015 ). CSR initiatives have also been linked to  price, with tourists who have stronger pro-environmental attitudes  stating they would pay more for hotels that implement green initiatives  ( Kang, Stein, Heo, &amp; Lee, 2012 ). Yet, we have only limited understanding about the  relative  importance of CSR compared to other product attributes. For example: to what extent would consumers tolerate  reductions in accommodation luxury to support socially responsible  accommodation providers?  A recent review of CSR research in the hotel context revealed a  paucity of empirical studies on this topic, with the authors concluding  that  “ consumer reactions to CSR and the link between CSR and corporate financial performance (CFP) are still important gaps regarding  research on CSR in the hotel industry ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p.  15). They note wide variation in the quality and clarity of company  communications of their CSR activities, stating that  “ extra effort trying  to find out the best way to communicate CSR to the different stakeholders would be welcomed ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p. 35).  Specifically, on the impact of CSR strategies on consumers, the review  revealed most studies to be quantitative and use structural equation  modelling to examine relationships between variables, and also noted  the  “ absolute predominance of studies on Asian markets and, particularly, in China ”  ( Serra-Cantallops et al., 2018 , p. 28). They also note the  lack  of  managerially  useful  segmentation  studies  ( Dolnicar  &amp;  Lazarevski, 2009 ) and a general presupposition by researchers that all  consumers will react to CSR messages in the same way. They suggest  that  “ segmentation studies within these groups could shed new light on  the underlying mechanisms linking CSR to consumers  …”  ( SerraCantallops et al., 2018 , p. 33).  With a view to filling these identified gaps in knowledge, the present study poses the following research questions in the context of  holiday accommodation choice: (1) What is the relative impact of environmental and community CSR initiatives on holiday accommodation  choice?

Respondents are asked to trade-off product features, similarly to real life choice situations. Choice experiments also allow for  inclusion of attributes of interest, the impact of which can be simulated.  We identified 11 characteristics salient to holiday accommodation  choice by reviewing popular online hotel booking sites: price, internet,  kitchen, check in, washer and dryer, parking, air conditioning, indoor fireplace and a pool. To check the appropriateness of these characteristics we compared them with another recent study that examined the  price impact of the full range of accommodation characteristics which  currently appear on Airbnb accommodation websites ( Hrobath, Leisch,  &amp; Dolnicar, 2017 ). We then included two types of CSR initiatives  commonly employed by accommodation providers ( Holcomb et al.,  2007 ): community donations and environmental sustainability. We  defined each attribute at a number of levels ( Table 1 ). Price, community  donations and contribution to environmental sustainability each had five levels. To test the effect of cause proximity and message framing on  CSR messages, we used two levels of cause proximity (local and international) and two levels of message framing (positive and negative). We  added a base level (does not donate/contribute) to each CSR attribute.  The other attributes were each defined at two levels typical for hotel  booking sites. These attributes are either present or not (e.g. pool and fireplace).  Given that the choice \n",

These 100 holiday accommodation options were randomly divided over choice sets. Each choice  set contained three alternative holiday homes to choose from. Study  participants could also choose not to book any of the available options.  Table 2  shows a sample choice set.  Each respondent evaluated 12 choice sets (saw 36 choice alternatives). This means that responses from three respondents were  needed to evaluate one complete design. For each choice set, respondents saw the following instructions:  “ Imagine you are planning a  one-week summer holiday with six friends. They have given you the job of  booking a holiday home.

Also, the  choice sets were embedded in an online questionnaire system developed by one of the author's universities specifically to support random  distribution of choice alternatives across choice sets. This approach  avoids dominant choice sets (where the most desirable choice is obvious) and prevents order effects.  Involvement in community issues  was measured with an altruism scale  ( Rushton, Chrisjoh, &amp; Fekken, 1981 ). The full scale has 20 items, but  three were not relevant to this study (e.g. one item refers to pulling a  neighbour's car out of the snow; most parts of Australia never see  snow). Examples of items include  “ I have given money to a charity ” ,  “ I  have given directions to a stranger ”  and  “ I have helped an acquaintance  to move households ” .  Involvement with environmental issues  was measured using the revised  New Environmental Paradigm scale ( Dunlap, Van Liere, Mertig, &amp;  Jones, 2000 ). Participants saw 15 statements about the environment  and indicated their agreement from strongly disagree ( − 2) to strongly  agree (+2). Examples of items include  “ humans are severely abusing  the environment ” ,  “ plants and animals have just as much right to exist  as humans ”  and  “ the balance of nature is very delicate and easily  upset ” .  Important aspects of holiday travel  was measured using a list of 25  features of holidays. Participants expressed importance on a binary  (yes/no) answer scale. Aspects included:  “ I want to rest and relax ” ,  “ I  want many entertainment facilities ” ,  “ I am interested in the lifestyle ” ,  “ it is important to me that I can feel safe ”  and  “ cultural offerings and  sights are a crucial factor ” .  Personal characteristics  of participants included age, sex, marital  status, employment status, whether they have children and perceptions  of their household income level compared to most Australians.  3.2.

It is reasonable to assume the existence of homogeneous tourist segments, which have different holiday  home booking preferences.

Following transcription, 17  codes were identified in the data, and later arranged into 8 categories  (see  Table 6  below). Both codes and categories were in a final step  realigned with existing literature in order to develop key themes  ( Bazeley, 2007 ).  The example below (FG4/N) illustrates a set of initial codes (underlined) which was identified in the raw data. For each code the frequency (how often was it mentioned), extensiveness (by how many  people) and intensity (how much passion or force was behind the  comments) were identified ( Krueger &amp; Casey, 2014 ).

The codes were then  arranged into categories, such as ‘Memorable Event Experience’ (e.g.,  do something a little bit different; extra entertainment; memory of  going on the steam train with nana and granddad) or ‘familial bonding’  (e.g., extended family; going on the steam train with nana and  granddad; I've connected with him). The codes and categories were in a  final step realigned with the QOL theoretical frameworks discussed  above, to develop key themes. In the example below this would be:  ‘familial bonding’ through ‘leisure’ and ‘Memorable Event Experiences’  contributes to participants' ‘emotional well-being’ (a nicer feeling for  me; he's enjoyed it; quality-of-life), and enhances interpersonal relations and physical well-being, which are key indicators of family QOL.  FG4/N: It's just taking them out of that home environment to do  something a little bit different which will kind of give them that  little bit of extra entertainment for half an hour, which makes … I  mean my husband didn't come that day because he was playing golf,  but the rest of the extended family was with us. So actually, he's now  got that memory of going on the steam train with nana and  granddad and actually it's a nicer feeling for me in terms of, like you  say, the quality of life because I feel like I've done something with  him, I've connected with him and he's enjoyed it.

The questionnaire  consisted of a total of 25 questions, including demographic questions  such as ethnic background, postcode, number and age of children.  When handing these out at live events, participants were strongly encouraged to discuss each question as a family in order to capture their  aggregated perspective (as advocated by  Poston et al., 2003 ), rather  than merely one family member filling in the questionnaire on behalf of  the entire family unit.  Over a period of four months in 2016 (June–September) a range of  events across Hertfordshire with a specific family focus, program or  theme were targeted.

In line with the above identified definition of  family as “two or more persons who share resources, share responsibility for decisions, share values and goals, and have a commitment to  one another over time, (…) regardless of blood, legal ties, adoption, or  marriage” ( DeFrain &amp; Asay, 2007 , p. 284), the final sample therefore  encompassed all respondents that fitted these criteria. This included for  example, grandparents attending the event with their grandchildren, or  families with children from a previous marriage. In terms of the children's’ age range, any family with at least one child aged between 2 and  10 years was included.  Based on these criteria and after further excluding questionnaires  that were not fully completed, the final sample was 303 questionnaires.  The number of children per family unit within this sample ranged from  1 to 6. Respondents’ ethnic backgrounds were representative of the  wider demographic statistics of the region (see ONS 2011 Census and  2016 Estimates), with 83.1% British, 7.4% European, 1.9% Australian/  New Zealand, 1.3% Indian, 0.9% American, 0.9% South African, 0.9%  Arabic, and 2.1% Mixed Race. The remaining 1.5% identified themselves as Peruvian, Caribbean, Philippine and Sri Lankan. In terms of  their current place of residence, the majority (94.2%) were local to the  area where the chosen events took place (their postcode was within a  10-mile radius of St Albans, Harpenden, Hatfield, Welwyn Garden City  or Pirton).  The number of respondents from each of the ten events/festivals are  shown in  Table 7 . The range of different types of events/festivals is  wide but the number of respondents that were obtained at each event/  festival was dependent upon many factors (e.g. time, personnel, and  weather conditions).

This is a relatively wide range  of estimates but is to be expected because attendance at different types  of event is unlikely to be independent (it is not surprising to find that  those who go to music events are most likely to regularly attend festivals and those who go to sporting events are least likely to attend festivals). To overcome this lack of independence, it is sensible to discard  the highest and lowest estimates above and use the median figure (here  50.5%) as the best estimate of the proportion of families who regularly  attend festivals.  Applying this logic to all the types of event/festival gives the estimates in  Table 9 . From this information it can be seen that those attending school fairs need to be well-represented in the sample of respondents and certainly better represented than those at sporting or  music events, for instance. More precisely, for each respondent attending a sporting event, 2.133 (80%/37.5%) respondents attending a  school fair are needed and for each respondent attending a music event,  2.206 (80%/36.3%) respondents attending a school fair are needed.  Retaining the total sample size of 303 and applying this logic, the  weights and effective sample sizes shown in  Table 10  can be obtained.</div></span>"

Methodology  Traditional data collection methods such as questionnaire surveys  are subject to the potential limitations of inefficient and incomplete.  Advances in mobile technologies have led to the creation of large volumes of user-generated data, such as travel movements ( Li, Law, Vu,  Rong, &amp; Zhao, 2015 ). Thus, to obtain accurate results and implications,  data were retrieved via the mobile phone signal of China Unicom as  smartphone is considered a necessity for tourists. Hence, data retrieval  through mobile phone signal makes data more comprehensive. This  method enabled researchers to track the movements of tourists travelling to Tibetan attractions rated 4A or above from September to November 2018. China's tourist attraction rating categories were established in 1999 and extended in 2004. This rating system aims to  determine the quality of the attractions, such as safety and cleanliness  ( China National Tourism Administration, 2018 ). It is based on the  ‘Categories and Rating Standard of Tourist Attractions’ code advocated  by  Ryan, Gu, and Meng (2009) , which includes five categories ranging  from 1A (lowest) to 5A (highest). In the present study, Tibetan attractions were rated according to this system. On the basis of the administrative regions in Tibet, 19 attractions rated category 4A or above  were retrieved ( Fig. 1 ). Ngari prefecture is located in western Tibet that  witnessed Tibet civilization. Xigaze prefecture, the previous political  and cultural center, is full of prosperous Buddhism culture. Lhasa prefecture is located in the central part of Tibet, and is a spiritual city with  a number of temples and monasteries. Located in the southern Tibet,  Shannan prefecture is the origin of Tibetan culture. Lying in the southeastern part of Tibet, Nyingchi prefecture is surrounded by natural  sceneries such as beautiful lakes and lush growth of forests.  Among the 19 retrieved attractions, two ( Kangrinboqe Peak, Magical  Mountain and Holy Lake ) are located in Ngari prefecture (NgP), two are  located ( Everest Base Camp and Sagya Monastery ) in Xigaze prefecture  (XiP), eight are located ( Jokhang Temple, Norbulinka Monastery, The  Potala Palace, Drepung Monastery, Yak Museum of Tibet, Tibet Museum,  Lake Namtso and Nyangra Flok Customers Resort ) in Lhasa prefecture  (LhP), one is located ( Samye Temple ) in Shannan prefecture (ShP) and  six are located ( Lulang Forest, Mount Namjagbarwa, Basom Lake, Yarlung  Zangbo River, Nanyi Valley and Midui Glacier ) in Nyingchi prefecture  (NyP). </div></span>"

              "), such as Jieba and NLTK, in Python programming language, including data cleaning and tokenization. Finally, statistical  analysis of thematic words, semantic association analysis and visualization are performed on the data.  3.2. Data collection  In previous studies, most articles only retrieved online travel review  data from a single platform ( Banerjee &amp; Chua, 2016 ;  Cheng, Fu, Sun,  Bilgihan, &amp; Okumus, 2019 ;  Fang et al., 2016 ;  Guo et al., 2017 ;  Kim,  Park, Yun, &amp; Yun, 2017 ;  Liu et al., 2018 ;  Schuckert et al., 2015b ;  Ye, Li,  &amp; Wang, 2014 ;  Zhang et al., 2016a ,  b ) or even from only a single  destination ( Lui, Bartosiak, Piccoli, &amp; Sadhya, 2018 ). To obtain the  most representative data in this study, we choose three major OTAs  platforms (Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng) as the data source and extract  online travel reviews using Python programming language. Ctrip  ( http://www.ctrip.com/ ), Tuniu ( http://www.tuniu.com ) and Tongcheng ( http://www.ly.com ) are the top three Chinese OTAs and lead  new business to customer (\n",

              ") tourism e-commerce websites. As of the  end of December 2017, their market shares were 43.6%, 22.7% and  11.1%, respectively. Ctrip, which was founded in 1999, is one of the  largest integrated online travel service companies. By the end of May  2018, it had more than 300 million registered users. Tuniu provides  more than one million tourism products for consumers, covering selfhelp, self-driving, cruise, hotels, visas, tickets for scenic spots, company  tours, etc. Tongcheng is the most professional online service platform  for leisure tourism in China. According to a report from iResearch.cn, in  May 2018, the active monthly users of Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng  were  68.55  million,  8.3  million  and  22.2  million,  respectively  ( iResearch, 2018 ). The platforms of Ctrip ( Lu &amp; Liu, 2016 ;  Qi, Li, Zhu, &amp;  Shi, 2017 ), Tuniu ( Lian &amp; Yu, 2017 ;  Zhang &amp; Zhou, 2018 ) and Tongcheng ( Li &amp; Yi, 2014 ;  Wang &amp; Wang, 2018 ) have been used many times  as samples in prior studies; therefore, the selection of these data platforms for online travel reviews is reasonable.  The data collection took place in June 2018. We collected review  data on the Top ten tourist cities in China released by the  2018 Global  Destination Marketing Summit and World Culture and Tourism Forum  ( ShaanxiDaily, 2018 ), including Shanghai, Beijing, Xi'an, Chengdu,  Hangzhou, Sanya, Hongkong, Guangzhou, Xiamen and Nanjing. Web  crawlers ( Xiang et al., 2017 ) designed in the Python programming  language were used to mimic a user's access to the three OTA websites  for all the tourist products of the ten cities, and the user ID, product  name, review text and review time of the search results were downloaded, as shown in  Fig. 2 . To maintain the timeliness of the data, we  only crawled online review information from January 2015 to June  2018.  3.3. Data pre-processing  All reviews collected from the three OTA platforms were pre-processed by four operations: data cleaning, tokenization, stop word removal and the translation of Chinese words to English. Data cleaning  was used to detect and remove inaccurate or useless records from online  textual data, such as misspellings and non-target language ( Guo et al.,  2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ), leaving only valuable tourism-related information. In this study, we first deleted reviews with a textual length  of less than 15 words. The length of the textual portion of the review  positively affects  “ helpfulness ”  perceptions ( Racherla &amp; Friske, 2012 ).  Cai, Xu, and Wu (2014)  also found that information value was poor  when the length of Chinese language-based online reviews was less  than 15 words. Second, because multiple repeated reviews posted by a  single user may lead to statistical bias, we kept only one record in a  user's duplicate record. Finally, we deleted the reviews that were advertisements to ensure the authenticity and accuracy of the data samples.  Table 1  presents the results after the data cleaning of the reviews  in Ctrip, Tuniu and Tongcheng. We collected approximately 47,000  reviews from Ctrip, 51,000 reviews from Tuniu, and 67,000 reviews  from Tongcheng. Although Tongcheng had the largest number of reviews, Tuniu had the highest number of Chinese words (approx.  4,084,000) and the highest average length of reviews (80.32 words).  The purpose of tokenization is to divide travel review texts into  keywords, phrases or other meaningful elements, such as tourist spots  and travel feelings ( Guo et al., 2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ). For this study,  we applied the existing open source tool LTP (see  http://ir.hit.edu.cn/  ltp/ ) provided by the Research Centre for Social Computing and Information Retrieval of Harbin Institute of Technology ( Che, Li, &amp; Liu,  2010 ) and Python 3.6.4 (see  https://www.python.org ) to implement  tokenization and stop word removal for all effective reviews. The stop  word list, which consisted of 1893 Chinese words, came from Harbin  Institute of Technology and has been widely applied in opinion mining  and analytics.  Because the reviews were posted in Chinese, we adopted the following translation method to ensure the accuracy of the translation.  First, we divided the translators into two groups, with two persons in  each group. The first group was led by the first author of this article,  and the second group was led by an English teacher. All participants  possessed an excellent level of English and were able to use native  English. After dividing the group, we selected the top 2000 words in  thematic word tables for each platform for translation. The translation  work of each group was performed independently and simultaneously,  and no discussion was held until the formal translation was completed.  If uncertain thematic words were found in the translation, the participants marked them as  “ uncertain ”  thematic words and discussed them  in the next step. After completing the first translation, we compared the  translation results of the two groups one by one to avoid translation  bias, especially with regard to the  “ uncertain ”  thematic words.  3.4. Data analysis  3.4.1. Analysis of thematic words  A thematic word is a word with a definite meaning and the characteristics of conciseness and timeliness as well a large amount of information. An analysis of thematic words aims to remove words that are  meaningless and thereby affect the research results of the keywords  extracted from the online review text through data pre-processing. It  also aims to calculate the frequency of keywords in the text ( Yuan &amp;  Wu, 2016 ). The Jieba toolkit was used for the tokenization and stop  word removal of all the review data. A Chinese word segmentation  module was used that developed by Chinese programmers in Python.  This approach was mostly used in the \n",

              " and the Chinese word  segmentation in search engines. Additionally, the NLTK was used to  calculate the frequency of the thematic words. The calculation formula  is as shown in Equation  (1) :  (1)  where  F  is the frequency of a thematic word  i  in each platform,  R  is the  occurrence number of  i  in the review text,  L  is the length of  i , and  L  is  the length of all words in each platform. Therefore, in this study, the  range of  t  is from 1 to 3, representing the three OTAs platforms, respectively.  3.4.2. \n",

In this  study, we first constructed semantic association bigram co-occurrence  phrases of thematic words using NTLK and Jieba. For example, an  original review appeared as follows:  整 体 不 错 。 住 宿 和 餐饮 挺 好 的 , 行 程 安 排 也 好 。 就 是 导 游 服 务 能 再 提  高 就 更 好 了 。  The translation is as follows:  Overall good. The accommodations and dining are fine, and the  schedule is also good. It would be even better if the tour guide service  could be further improved.  After pre-processing of the review, the text was as follows:  整 体 / 不 错 / 。 / 住 宿 / 餐饮 / 挺 好 /,/ 行 程 / 安 排 / 也 好 / 。 / 就 是 / 导 游 / 服  务 / 能 / 再 / 提 高 / 就 / 更 好 / 了 / 。  The results of the semantic association bigrams co-occurrence of  thematic words are shown in  Table 2 .

The quantitative data  provided evidence of the financial impact of the program in terms of  direct expenditure made by the convention centre on NSW produce.  This data represented the majority of the convention centre's NSWbased suppliers. The qualitative data allowed an in-depth analysis of the  strategy and its outcomes in the context of the issues facing regional  NSW.

Interviews were conducted by the authors with nine NSW producers, either at their workplaces or by phone. The suppliers were chosen  from a list supplied by the convention centre and represent a range of  food and beverage types ( Table 1 ). Nine producers captures 15 per cent  of local farmers who supply the convention centre. Interviews were also  conducted with a state government minister, and a state Wine Industry  Association representative. In addition, interviews with eight executive  staff from the convention centre, and one regional destination manager  were conducted on the premises of the convention centre.  A semi-structured research instrument consisting of 14 open-ended  questions was developed to capture information on the arrangements  producers had in place to supply the convention centre, as well as how  their businesses had altered as a result of supplying produce to the  convention centre. The research instrument was adapted for interviews  with the state politician, wine industry association and the state tourism  and event sector representative body. These interviews lasted between  45 and 90 min. In the majority of instances, post interviews involved  tours of suppliers’ work sites and farms. The research instrument used  in interviews with the convention centre executives consisted of 12  open-ended  questions  designed  to  capture  knowledge  and  understanding of the aims of the organisation and practices required to  implement a SFSC strategy. These interviews also lasted between 45  and 90 min.  All interviews occurred in the period January–May 2018. Most interviews were conducted in person with three conducted over the telephone.

Data collection  The sample for the study was drawn from the micro-task crowdsourcing platform Amazon Mechanical Turk. Participants were recruited from the United States. The sample included respondents from  all 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. We  collected a total of 1256 useable responses: 618 from customers who  had stayed at an Airbnb in the last year, and 638 from customers who  had stayed at a hotel for the purpose of leisure in the last year. Separate  surveys were administrated for the Airbnb and hotel samples, and  guests traveling for business were excluded from the surveys.  3.2. Measures  Brand authenticity was measured using items from  Akbar and  Wymer (2017) . Object authenticity was measured using items adapted  from  Lalicic and Weismayer (2017)  and  Ramkissoon and Uysal (2011) .  Interpersonal authenticity was measured with items from  Yi et al.  (2017) , while intrapersonal authenticity was measured using items  from  Wallace, Buil, and Chernatony (2014) . Well-being and memorability were measured using scales from  Mody et al. (2017) . Brand love  was measured using  Carroll and Ahuvia’s (2006)  scale. Brand loyalty  was measured using four items from  Zeithaml, Berry, and Parasuraman  (1996)  and  Hanks, Line, and Mattila (2016) . All items were measured  on 7-point Likert scales, and are presented in more detail in  Table 2 .  3.3.

Methodology  This paper proposes an empirical study on Mediterranean cruise  destinations in the year 2015. The study is limited to those destinations  that received an amount equal to or larger than 500,000 passengers  during the year, which was analogous to the data compiled by Wild  ( Ramón, 2012 ). In this manner, cruise passengers constituted an important target group for the potential use of PT. For each port of call,  the PTH accessible with PT is determined and compared with the PTH  accessible with DT in relation to the following definitions and variables.  The potential itinerary (PI) is the route of travel from the point of  origin to the destination. The point of origin is the cruise terminal (CT)  located at the port of call (in cases where there is more than one  terminal, the terminal furthest from the tourist attraction was selected).  This study used two criteria for selecting the destination. Based on the  first criteria, only destinations declared as world heritage sites (WHSs)  by UNESCO were considered. This criterion was set owing to the large  number of tourist attractions in the Mediterranean, and the fact that  this international nomination provided the destination with an alternative attraction capacity when compared with the WHSs at the port  city. Based on the second criteria, the WHSs at the port-city are not  considered. The study is limited to destinations with a maximum  distance of 150 km from the CT, excluding port-city's WHSs.  The estimated travel time from the point of origin to the destination  (T ) is the time required for each itinerary, depending on the mode of  transport used (DT or PT), where T  is the total sum of estimated values  of time for each means of transport t(n), or that which is the same:  T  =  Σ t(n). During a leisure trip, the time invested in the journey to the  tourist attraction infers an inefficiency in the tourist experience ( Rus  Mendoza, Campos, &amp; Nombela, 2003 ); therefore, the tourist will tend to  reduce it to a minimum. The number of changes in the means of  transport (N) is related to the success in the use of public transport. For  the DT mode, N = 1, as the displacement is direct and tourists use a  \n",

              " of transport, usually the ‘tourist bus’, while for PT, N ≥ 2,  as the first and last mode of travel is ‘on foot’.  The calculation of these variables is carried out using the Google  Maps platform. This has been used in studies on time and distance  ( Raknes &amp; Hunskaar, 2014 ) in the design of vehicle routes ( Santos,  Coutinho-Rodrigues, &amp; Antunes, 2011 ) through the development of its  cartographic technique ( Peterson, Dobson, Fandry, &amp; Shrader, 2012 ).  Google Maps allows for the selection of different itinerary options by  varying means of transport: road vehicle, public transport, on foot,  bicycle, and plane. By entering the origin and destination data, the  platform designs an itinerary for each alternative and illustrates the  sequence of the transit mode and its T . In this study, the travel mode  ‘road vehicle’ is selected for DT, without choosing any of its avoidable  options (motorways, tolls, and ferries). For PT, the ‘transit’ mode is  selected and the available route options are ‘best route’, ‘fewer transfers’, and ‘less walking’. The route option selected is ‘best route’ as it  optimises the variables T  and N.  The Google Maps platform results correspond to the values obtained  in winter (22–26 January) between 09:00 and 10:00 a.m. The results  consider that the cruise ship would dock early in the morning in order  for tourists to have time to visit the WHSs in the hinterland. However,  for PT with T  &lt; 60′, a second measurement is added for summer  (19–21 July) to compare the possible variations between the peak and  off-peak seasons. </div></span>"

The specific hotel was  chosen as the research setting because it meets the research objectives.  First, it is a luxury beach resort that operates seasonally (for a period of  six months, usually from mid April to mid October). Second, as the  initial contact with the Human Resource (HR) manager showed it has  an organized HR department with formally implemented HRM policies  regarding i.e. appraisal, training, staffing, and a strong customer-centric  culture with intense emphasis on quality service and customer satisfaction. In total, the hotel employs 400 people. Forty of them (10%),  located in the sales, accounting and HRM departments, are employed  all year round. The rest of the employees (360/90%) are seasonal and  have a diversified profile. In detail, 280 (77.7%) of the seasonal employees work at the hotel for 5–6 months. Most, of them live on unemployment benefit for the rest period of the year, whilst around 50%  usually return to the hotel for the next season. Lastly, 80 (mainly underskilled) employees (22.3%) join the hotel usually for 3–4 months,  working as waiters, bartenders etc. Third, convenience, referring to  easy access due to acquaintance with the hotel's HR manager, was also a  reason.  4.2.

In the Husserlian phenomenological tradition, the researcher sets  aside their preconceptions or suppositions in a process known as  epoche  or bracketing, in order to examine the phenomenon with fresh eyes  ( Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018 ;  Szarycz, 2009 ). The researchers acknowledge  that they have been attendees of these types of exhibitions, with a  personal connection, having ancestors who fought in World War One  and having read books and viewed documentaries on the conflict. Attempts were made to bracket this experience, and concentrate on the  experiences as related by the participants. Nevertheless, it is acknowledged that our interpretation of the findings is  ‘ based on the cultural,  social, gender, class, and personal politics that we bring to research ’  ( Creswell &amp; Poth, 2018 , p. 228). This demonstration of self-reflexivity is  a hallmark of sincerity, and thus adds to the trustworthiness of the  study ( Tracy, 2010 ).  In-depth semi-structured interviews, lasting an hour on average,  were conducted with eight individuals involved in the organisation of  commemorative exhibitions across Australia that were staged as part of  the Centenary of World War One (hereafter referred to as  ‘ the  Centenary ’ ). Two participants worked for war memorials, while the rest  were employed by publicly funded and operated galleries or museums;  all of whom staged dark commemorative exhibitions as part of a rolling  programme that augmented their permanent collections. The individuals were either curators or directors/managers and had high levels of involvement in decisions made about the themes, content and  presentation of these exhibitions. A sample of this size is not uncommon  in a phenomenological study, given the requirement for a shared lived  experience which few people would collectively possess ( Szarycz,  2009 ). \n",

The same situation occurred with the key word “photography.”  Ultimately our initial list of key words was adjusted and 11 key words  were chosen for the analysis, as follows: animal, wild*(wildlife, wild  life), fauna, rights, resp*(respect, responsibility), welfare, species,  hunt* (hunting, hunters), fish*, angl* (angling, angler), exploit, and  protect* (protection). These key words were chosen by the researchers  as representing concern for the welfare of animals or encompassing  consumptive activities or perspectives that may demonstrate an anthropocentric focus within the policies.  Wherever possible, policies were downloaded and stored in electronic files for further analysis, as required. Some policies were not  downloadable and in such cases these policies were analyzed from their  various websites. The results of our policy analysis were stored in an  Excel document that detailed the country or territory's name, the policy  or strategy name, the year, if available, the website where the policy or  strategy was found.

Perceived vulnerability  is defined as the expectation of being exposed  to a threat ( Lwin &amp; Saw, 2007 ).

Methodology  The study began by establishing the goal to answer the questions of  how water flowed in Pattaya Bay and how safe it was for people interested in swimming and other water sports. Since more tourists visited the beach during summer than rainy season, and as calm waves  were ideal for most water sports, the summer season (December to  March) was chosen as the water current evaluation period. Therefore,  all field surveys were undertaken from February to March 2018, in  order to represent the time when the local tourism industry was at its  peak.

After the information gathering process was completed, an evaluation  of the water currents in Pattaya Bay was undertaken using MIKE21 HD.  2.1. Data gathering  Bathymetric maps were collected from public nautical charts, as  well as information requested from the General Bathymetric Chart of  the Oceans (GEBCO) ( GEBCO, 2018 ). Furthermore, detailed bathymetry was surveyed by a professional echo-sounding team. The GEBCO  data was utilized to construct a map with a grid size of 200 × 200 m  ( Fig. 2 ), while the detailed bathymetric information was used to build a  local bathymetry having a grid size of 10 × 10 m ( Fig. 3 ). Tidal information at Chanthaburi station and Nakornsithamarat stations  ( Saengsupavanich, 2017 ), recorded between 9 February 2018 and 10  March 2018 ( Fig. 2 ), was collected from the Marine Department since  both stations served as a proper boundary condition of the Gulf of  Thailand. The tidal information at Pattaya Bay was also recorded  during this duration for calibration purposes ( Fig. 3 ). All data was referred to the national mean sea level (MSL). Since calibrating the water  level could not indicate how strong the water current flowed, an  Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) was installed for 24 h to  measure the speed and direction of the water current. The 24-hr ADCP  data  was  adequate  for  the  water  current  calibration  process  ( Saengsupavanich, 2011a ,  2012 ,  2014 ,  2016 ,  2019 ).  2.2. Modeling procedures  MIKE21 HD is a general numerical modeling system for the simulation of water levels and flows in river and coastal areas ( DHI, 2018 ). It  has been applied in many studies in rivers, estuaries, and coastal areas  ( Babu, Vethamony, &amp; Desa, 2005 ;  Hakim et al., 2015 ;  Lumborga &amp;  Windelin, 2003 ;  Saengsupavanich, 2011a ,  2011b ,  2019 ;  Vethamony  et al., 2007 ).

The analysis began by transforming field data into a format that  conformed with MIKE21 HD. Firstly, a bathymetric map with a grid size  of 200 × 200 m (called  “ coarse-grid ”  later on) was constructed in order  to simulate water current flow for the whole Gulf of Thailand. As the  coarse-grid simulation had only one open boundary ( Fig. 2 ), water level  variations at Chanthaburi station and Nakornsithamarat station were  used to create a line boundary condition. Differences among the water  levels of the stations forced the water to flow. The domain's initial  surface elevation was set to an average value of all water level stations  at the first time step. No atmospheric or wave forcings were added to  the simulations, because the actual water elevation at any time was a  summation of tidal water level, wave, wind, and other factors  ( Saengsupavanich, 2017 ). This research utilized the measured tidal  levels at the Chanthaburi and Nakornsithamarat stations, thus automatically including all factors occurring at the time. Adding other  forcings to the simulation would be redundant. The coarse-grid modeling was simulated between 9 February 2018 and 10 March 2018 with  a time step of 60 s, resulting in a maximum Courant Number of 8.35. At  the beginning of the simulation, both  and ) in the  domain were zero. Therefore, an additional model-day was undertaken  to warm up the simulation but was ignored during the flow analysis.  Calibration parameters used in MIKE21 HD, namely the Manning  number and the Eddy viscosity, were randomized. Once the calibration  result was satisfactory, the simulated water level at Pattaya Bay was  extracted to compare it with the measured one.  Another bathymetric map with a grid size of 10 × 10 m (called  “fine-grid ”  later on) was prepared to simulate the current flow in  Pattaya Bay. Since the fine-grid simulation had three open boundaries  ( Fig. 3 ), water level variations along them were extracted from the  coarse-grid simulation result (from 9 February 2018 to 10 March 2018).  There was no need to add more wind or wave forcings because they  were automatically included in the fine-grid simulation as they were  embedded in the boundaries extracted from the coarse-grid result. The  simulation time step of 2 s was selected, resulting in a maximum  Courant Number of 3.25. Simulations of extreme cases were not the  objective of this research, because it aimed to study the water current in  summer when the weather was calm and when the tourism industry  was at its peak. Finally, water current speed and direction at a specified  station were extracted and compared with those measured by the  ADCP, ensuring that the Pattaya Bay water current simulation was reliable. </div></span>"

Methods  This study utilises VAR instead of the traditional econometric  models, which insu ffi ciently describe the dynamic relationship between  variables. By contrast, VAR can accurately capture dynamic variables  by using non-structural methods. Before using the impulse response  function of VAR, we need to test the stationarity and co-integration of  relevant variables. Therefore, we first use the augmented Dickey – Fuller  (ADF) test to examine stationarity and the augmented Engle – Granger  (AEG) test (two-step co-integration relationship test) to examine cointegration.

Using VAR to analyse the variation of dynamic multi-variables has  the following advantages: 1) the model is less constrained by theory  because all variables are treated as endogenous and are symmetrically  estimated in the equation; 2) it avoids default variables; and 3) it is  more convenient and intuitive to analyse long-term dynamic effects  between the SVI and tourists.

The initial input data of the various meteorological elements used in the  Envi-met simulation is shown in  Table 5 .  In this study, the whole simulation is 48 h, starting from midnight  00:00, 28th, 2016 with a calculation of 1 min. The simulation results  are output into an hour basis. We obtain the data at 1.5 m high level.  The detailed information of all the paving material is shown in  Table 6 .  The three-dimensional model is shown in  Fig. 9 .  The material of the buildings in the block is brick, and the material's  color, emissivity and albedo is dark, 0.9 and 0.3. About the vegetation  in the model, plant and vegetation are not only symbolized as a porous  media to solar insolation and wind, but are treated as a biological body  which can be influenced by the evapotranspiration in the surrounding  environment. As Envi-met analyzes vegetation based on leaf area density (LAD) and not leaf area identity (LAI), equation which shows relationship between the two parameters ( Bruse &amp; Fleer, 1998 ):  (1)  h is the height of the tree (m)  z is vertical grid size  LAI is the leaf area index  LAD is the leaf area density ( ). The tree models are provided  by Envi-met database. However, all modelling systems must be validated against field measurement to determine their ability in producing  accurate outputs within the urban environment. Therefore field measurements were conducted in this study to validate the simulated results  with the recorded data.  2.6.

Fuzzy theory  Decision making has been debated as a complex and vague process  for many years. This vagueness, indeed makes various problems for  decision makers. In 1965, theory of “fuzzy set” has been introduced by  Zadeh (1965)  to facilitate decision makers' subjective judgments and  more general qualitative assessments. A number of fuzzy methods have  been applied as a decision making tool in several situations. According  to  Chou, Liu, Huang, Yih, and Han (2011) , gauging respondents’ opinion through \n",

              " seems inadequate and too simple, owing to  the fact that human thinking is a fuzzy process and simple questionnaire design would not be able to fully reflect the feelings and  cognitions of the respondents. This is particularly the case for the  business model concept which is known as a vague and fuzzy concept  with no generally accepted definition ( Al-Debei &amp; Avison, 2010 ;  Daft &amp;  Albers, 2013 ;  Zott, Amit, &amp; Massa, 2011 ). In this study, we propose  fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (FMCDM) to determine the  weights and ranking of designated business model criteria and subcriteria.  3.2. Fuzzy set and fuzzy numbers  It has been argued that human thinking is rarely based on numbers,  but the key elements deriving human thinking and judgments are linguistic terms or fuzzy set labels ( Bellman &amp; Zadeh, 1970 ;  Zadeh, 1965 ).  A fuzzy set displays a continuum of grades of membership which ranges  between 0 and 1. As can be expected, a 0 value sign indicates that the  element does not belong to the set, and a 1 value sign indicates that the  element fully belongs to the set. Accordingly, the value which lies between 0 and 1 indicates a partial membership. Hence, fuzzy numbers  represent an extended \n",

Fuzzy numbers can be displayed as triangular fuzzy number  (TFN) comprising three points:  = (l, m, u)  (1)  With l, m, u, indicating the smallest possible value, the most promising  value and the largest possible value, respectively. Eq.  (2)  represents a  triangular membership function for .  (2)  Several operators can be performed on TFN. Four basic operators  are listed below.  Assuming  = ( ) and = ( ), then:  (i) Addition  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (ii) Multiplication  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (iii) Subtraction  of  a  TFN  :  ( )  ( )  =  ( )  (iv) Division of a TFN  :  = ( , , )  3.3. Fuzzy AHP  To solve multi-criteria problems in practical situations, AHP is  known as a common method. Developed by  Saaty (1977) , AHP have  been used in many disciplines. That is, scholars have used fuzzy concept  in conjunction with analytical hierarchy method. Primarily, the goal of  AHP is to evaluate experts' information, opinions and cognitions.  However, expressing these judgments in exact numbers seems to be  difficult due to the fuzzy nature of the language. It appears that  Chang’s  (1996)  fuzzy AHP and its extension analysis would act as a remedy to  tackle the abovementioned problem. The steps of Chang's \n",

Accordingly,  Jick (1979 , p. 602) suggests “organizational  researchers can improve the accuracy of their judgments by collecting  different kinds of data bearing on the same phenomenon”. Therefore,  various viewpoints of a panel of ten experts in the fields of aviation and  transportation have been obtained in two phases. During phase one, the  selection of study criteria and sub-criteria have been validated, while  the second phase included a pairwise comparison questionnaire to  evaluate the relative importance of each criterion over another.  Due to the fuzzy nature of experts’ viewpoints, measurement instruments corresponding to each criterion followed the settings of fuzzy  theory including five levels: just equal, moderately more important,  strongly more important, very strongly more important, and absolutely  more important.

Model  The findings of  Magee (1973) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee (1985) ,  Rose and  Yellen (1989) ,  Brissimis and Leventakis (1989) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and  Brooks (1999) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and Ratha (2004) ,  Narayan and  Narayan (2004) ,  Bahmani-Oskooee and Hegerty (2010) , and  BahmaniOskooee and Fariditavana (2016)  helped to constitute the theoretical  foundation of our study, as they all essentially focus on the association  between exchange rates and trade balances. In this model, trade balance is a function of bilateral exchange rate between two trading  countries and both countries’ incomes. We model the U.S. tourism trade  balance as a function of the bilateral exchange rate between the U.S.,  Canada, Mexico, and the U.K., and their respective income levels.  Specifically, the model can be defined as  (1)  where  TOB  is defined as the rate of outbound tourist departures from  the USA to its tourism partner country i divided by the inbound tourist  arrivals to the USA from the same country.,  EXC  is the bilateral exchange rate between the USD and trading partner country i's currency,  I  is the U.S. Industrial Production Indexes (IPI) (as proxy of income),  and its trading partner country i's Industrial Production Indexes (IPI) (as  proxy of income).  3.2. Sample and data  The U.S. tourism trade balance is measured by the rate of outbound  tourist departures from the U.S. to the three study trading partners,  divided by the inbound tourist arrivals to the U.S. from these countries.  Table 1  presents the bilateral tourism arrivals statistics between the  U.S.–Canada, the U.S.–Mexico, and the U.S.–U.K. country pairs, along  with the respective tourism balances between the pairs.  The exchange rate variable refers to the real bilateral exchange rate  between the U.S. and Canada's, Mexico's, and the U.K.’s currencies. In  the case of Mexico, for instance, one U.S. dollar is converted to its  amount in Mexican pesos in our dataset to analyze the effect of exchange rate depreciations and appreciations on the U.S. tourism trade  balance. The monthly data covers the1 period from January 1996–June  2017 and hence in each country pair sample there are 258 observations.  The year 1996 was chosen as the beginning of our sample period for  two reasons. First, data for the countries included in the sample of this  study were collectively only available from January 1996. Second, and  most importantly, Mexico's central bank made a major policy change by  switching to a freely floating exchange rate system in December 1994  ( Madura, 2011 ). Thus, including the period prior to 1996 would yield  inconsistent and biased estimates, since the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.  all previously adopted a freely floating exchange rate system.  The U.S. tourism trade balance data was obtained from the National  Travel and Tourism Office. The Industrial Production Index, which is  used as a proxy for income in the absence of monthly gross domestic  product data, was obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  The \n",

              " exchange rates and consumer price indices were also obtained from the database of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Accordingly, the sample of this study consists of 774 country–month  observations.  The motivations for choosing the U.S. to examine the effect of exchange rates on the bilateral tourism trade balances with Canada,  Mexico, and the U.K. are numerous. First, the U.S. dollar is the dominant currency in the international trade marketplace. Second, Canada,  Mexico, and the U.S. are part of the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA), which is expected to increase bilateral trade between these countries. Third, the U.S. is one of the most developed  countries in the world alongside Canada and the U.K. Also, despite  economic differences, the U.S. is a major tourist destination for  Canadian, Mexican, and British tourists. Furthermore, former studies  examined the effect of exchange rate depreciations on the U.S. tourism  trade balance at an aggregate level (see e.g.,  Bahmani-Oskooee &amp;  Brooks, 1999 ;  Cheng et al., 2013 ;  Chi, 2015 ;  Junz &amp; Rhomberg, 1973 ).  Therefore, analyzing these effects at a disaggregate level in the context  of the U.S. allows us to compare our findings with those of previous  studies.  3.3. Empirical methodology  The stationarity of the variables needed to be tested prior to the  main functions of the study to analyze the effect of exchange rate on  tourism balances. In this context, we employed the Augmented  Dickey–Fuller (ADF), Phillips-Perron, and Zivot Andrews unit root tests  to determine the stationarity levels of the series included in our analyses. Test results showed that the series are stationary at I(1) levels at a  5% significance level. The results from the unit root tests are presented  on  Table 2 .  While there are several empirical models that can be employed to  analyze this relationship when the variables are not stationary at level I  (0), cointegration relationships between variables need to be examined  when the variables are not stationary in levels I(0), because a spurious  regression problem may occur if regression models like ordinary least  squares (OLS) are employed. Since the series in our sample are stationary at I(1) levels, we can employ both linear and nonlinear ARDL  cointegration and error\n",

While GDP deflator has been utilized in some tourism demand  studies (see e.g.,  Martins, Gan, &amp; Ferreira-Lopes, 2017 ), majority of the  tourism demand studies utilize the CPI to adjust respective exchange  rates (see e.g.,  Dogru et al., 2017 .

We used the nonlinear ARDL cointegration and error-correction  methodologies developed by  Shin, Yu, and Greenwood-Nimmo (2014,  pp. 281–314)  to examine the nonlinear relationship between the exchange rate and tourism trade balance. The empirical specification of  this model has been adapted from the studies of  Bahmani-Oskooee and  Fariditavana (2016)  and  Bahmani-Oskooee et al. (2016) . The model is  specified as follows.  (4)  where short- ( ) and long-run ( ) coefficients in  EXC  denote depreciations ( NEG ative) and appreciations ( POS itive), respectively. Thus,  equation  (4)  can be written in the following form.  (5)  where  (6)  (7)  specified to capture the effects of positive and negative changes in the  US dollar on tourism trade balance. Positive coefficients of the short( ) and long-run (  ) indicate improvement of the US  tourism trade balance following the currency depreciations, whereas  positive coefficients of the short- (  ) and long-run ( ) indicate deterioration of the US tourism trade balance following the  currency appreciations.  The ARDL model allows the examination of the both long- and  short-run relationship between exchange rate and tourism balances. We  first test whether there is a long-run relationship between the exchange  rate and tourism balances, which is reported on  Tables 3 and 4 . The F  test, which is based on the studies of  Shin et al. (2014)  and  Pesaran  et al. (2001) , shows whether the dependent and independent variables  are jointly cointegrated (i.e., there is a long-term relationship between  the exchange rate and tourism balances). A statistically significant F test  suggests that the exchange rate and tourism balances are cointegrated,  supporting the long-run relationship between exchange rate and  tourism balances. We also examine whether the J-curve effect exist. For  this purpose, testing the short-run effect of exchange rate on tourism  balances employing an error-correction model (\n",

Methodology  The hedonic literature ( Lancaster, 1966 ) provides a standard empirical setting for measuring the determinants of the value of a product.  Using a revealed preference approach based on actual price data, this  model infers consumers’ perception of quality differentials. This technique has been widely used in a variety of valuation issues, ranging  from housing ( Harding, Rosenthal, &amp; Sirmans, 2003 ) to more sensorial  environments, such as wine evaluation ( Combris, Lecocq, &amp; Visser,  1997 ). The model is popular in the tourism and hospitality domain  when assessing the determinants of price (see  Falk, 2008 ;  Rigall-ITorrent, R., &amp;; Fluvià, 2011 ;  Ropero, 2011 ;  Abrate &amp; Viglia, 2016 ) and  revenue performance (see  Hua &amp; Yang, 2017 ).  Despite its diffusion, there is no evidence whether the pricing  strategy itself can create value for the firm, as suggested by  Dutta et al.  (2003) . The original formulation of the model considers a perfectly  competitive setting where price provides a natural measure of the  product's market value, and is thus the \n",
              "<mark class=\"entity\" style=\"background: #ddd; padding: 0.45em 0.6em; margin: 0 0.25em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em;\">\n",

              "</mark>\n",
              ". However,  with the increasing complexity of pricing strategies and the diffusion of  dynamic pricing, choosing a unique measure of price as a proxy for  value has become more difficult. Even more so in the case of perishable  assets, where unsold inventory must be accounted. This means that the  use of a traditional hedonic pricing model would be simplistic, as it  would not consider pricing as a key lever to maximize values. For example, in the case of a hotel (or an airline), the implicit value of an  available room (or seat) depends not only on the average price charged  for a night (or a flight) but also on the average occupancy rate.  Coherently with the argument above, this work proposes a shift  from the standard framework to a  hedonic revenue model  [1], where the  \n",

              "</mark>\n",
              " ( R ) is a measure of  unit  revenue performance,  standardized over the available inventory capacity. On one hand, the  model includes a vector of variables ( P ) concerning the pricing strategy,  with particular reference to dynamic price variability. On the other  hand, explanatory variables include the group of qualitative attributes  ( H ) that would be typically included in a hedonic pricing setting.  (1)  The inclusion of pricing variables as explanatory rather than  dependent variables might raise causality concerns that need to be  addressed in each empirical model specification.  In order to test this proposed empirical model, the next section  presents a validation of the model in the hospitality industry.  3.1. Data  The empirical analysis consists of daily information on a sample of  840 hotels from 17 major European cities (Barcelona, Berlin, Brussels,  Dublin, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Geneva, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Milan,  Moscow, Paris, Prague, Rome, Vienna and Zurich). Data was collected  for four consecutive weeks in April 2016 (thus, 28 booking dates for  each hotel). The final dataset originates from the matching of two  sources of information: i) public information available on the web from  an OTA and ii) access to a database offered by STR, an organization  specialized in hotel data storage for academia and business.  Booking.com, the most popular distribution channel for hotels, was  the selected OTA and provided the web-based information. As previously stressed, Booking. com operates through the agency model,  which leaves inventory and price decisions to single hotels, leading to  an environment with heterogeneous individual dynamic pricing strategies. Because the goal is to investigate the dynamic pricing strategies  adopted by each hotel ( i ), the same booking-date ( t  = 1 to 28) must be  observed for a repeated number of times to check the price variability  trajectory while approaching the check-in date. Data were collected by  simulating the booking process using different days in advance ( d  = 60,  45, 30, 20, 10, 4, 1 and 0 days in advance). Consistently with this, while  focusing on the month of April, the data collection process started at the  beginning of February. To standardize the simulated booking process,  the search concerned a single night reservation for one person. Each  query provides information on the best available price for each 3, 4 and  5 star hotel in the city center, in accordance with some activated filtering options in the web search engine.  This data collection strategy records price changes while approaching the booking date and this strategy offers insights on intertemporal price distribution. In this respect, for each hotel and date and  in order to capture the use of dynamic pricing strategies, we computed  the median value of the price charged together with two measures: the  intertemporal coefficient of price variation (CV) and the price changes  count (PCC).  Fig. 2  shows the distribution of CV in the sample. Most  observations are in the range between 0.05 and 0.125, while it is possible to see a small portion of hotel price observations without any  intertemporal price variability (around 6.5%). The median value is  equal to 0.099. This means that, if one considers a hotel room whose  average price on booking. com is 100 Euro, the available price is likely  to vary from 90 to 110 depending on the advance-booking horizon. CV  exceeds 0.3 only in the 5% of observations. In these cases, with the  same average price and advance-booking horizon as above, prices  would likely be in the 70–130 range.  Together with prices, the queries recorded data concerning some  hedonic characteristics that are available in the search page for all the  listings, i.e., the average online review score, the page position of the  listing on the OTA and the hotel class. These hedonic attributes have  been recognized by previous past hedonic literature in tourism. In  particular,  Yang, Park, and Hu (2018)  have shown, in a meta-analysis  study, the role of online reviews on performance indicators and  Abrate  and Viglia (2016)  have integrated reputational factors in tourism hedonic models. Additionally,  Ert and Fleischer (2016)  have disclosed the  impact of mere position effects in booking hotels online and  Melis and  Piga (2017)  have shown differential effects by putting hotel room class  into the picture.  The database collected from the OTA was then matched with daily  hotel performance data provided by the STR SHARE Center. The database integrates information on the amount of rooms sold per day  (daily occupancy rate) and the corresponding revenues, measured by  the  RevPar , i.e. the revenues per available room. This measure is  commonly used in the hospitality industry as a key performance indicator, because it expresses the average unit revenue per available  room and facilitates a direct comparison across hotels with different  size (see  Phillips, Barnes, Zigan, &amp; Schegg, 2017 ). Different than a price  level, this measure also accounts for inventory sold (i.e. the occupancy  rate). The process of data matching was anonymized by STR to ensure  \n",

The CV is on average equal to 0.126, which means that prices  tend to move downward or upward by almost 13 percent with respect  to the mean price, depending on the time when a client makes the reservation for a certain hotel. The average review score measures the  perceived quality of the hotels. Its average is around 8.5 out of a  maximum of 10. The revenue performance indicates that each available  room pays off on average around 150 euros per night.  The hedonic revenue model could raise endogeneity concerns due to  the inclusion of pricing strategy as explanatory variables of unit revenues. In particular, the error term might be correlated with the alternative independent variables of interest proposed to pick up the level  (the  median ) and the dynamics ( CV  and  PCC ) of prices on the OTA. This  could happen if an unexpected event affects both performance and price  changes at the same time. For instance, the propensity to modify prices  can be greater when there is a higher than expected performance or  when the dynamics of the pricing strategy might be driven by changes  in macroeconomics variables that also have an impact on performance.  Price variability would be having an influence on performance, but  performance – and especially its evolution over time – would be having  an impact on the price variability. In particular, the error term  ε  can be  seen as the sum of two terms:  u , which is not correlated with  P , and  v ,  which is correlated with these price-related independent variables. The  latter term ( v ) captures the effect of all latent variables that could have  an impact on performance and the price-related variables.  To deal with and correct for this potential issue, we instrument  P .  When selecting the instruments, they must be correlated with these  variables but not correlated with the latent variables included in  v ( Antonakis, Bendahan, Jacquart, Lalive, &amp; Day, 2012 ).

It consisted of a structured questionnaire  comprising various scales adapted from literature to which a series of  questions were added in order to characterize the sample, which was  made up of 604 customers. In all cases, the latent variables analysed  were measured on a Likert-type response scale with 7 anchor points  where 1 represented  ‘ strongly disagree ’  and 7  ‘ strongly agree ’ . Three  versions of the questionnaire were used, in English, German and  Spanish, all translated by native speakers (back translation was used to  verify the accuracy of the translations). Furthermore, the scales were  pre-tested during a pilot phase.  Regarding the demographic profile of the sample, 54.8% of the  customers interviewed were women and 44% men, with an average age  of 40.91 years. The breakdown by nationality of the sample is as follows: 25.7% were German, 23.5% Spanish and 16.9% from the UK,  whilst other nationalities comprised the remaining 33.9%. Although for  84.9% of respondents it was the first time they had stayed at one of the  hotels included in the study, 36.8% had stayed at one of the chain's  hotels on a previous occasion. A mere 4.1% were travelling alone,  compared with 38.4% who were accompanied by their partner, 43.2%  as a family and 14.1% in a group. Regarding their booking habits,  36.1% had reserved their stay less than a month beforehand, 32.3%  between 1 and 2 months, 13.6% between 2 and 3 months and 16.7%  more than 3 months in advance. Finally, 52.2% of tourists booked the  hotel via a traditional travel agency, whilst the rest booked online.  The proposed model (see  Fig. 1 ), was estimated by means of a PLSSEM method using the SmartPLS program (v 3.2.7), which converged in  the fourth iteration.  The model is complex due to the existence of 3 s order constructs:  brand equity (BE); perception of value co-creation (CcV) and consumer  participation (CP).  To date, only a limited number of brand equity research projects  have adopted a formative approach to the conceptualisation of this  construct ( Delgado &amp; Munuera, 2002 ;  Arnett, Laverie, &amp; Meiers, 2003 ;  Buil et al., 2010 ;  Š eri ć  &amp; Gil-Saura, 2012 ;  Buil et al., 2013 ;  Kam, So, &amp;  King, n. d. ;  Martínez &amp; Nishiyama, 2017 ). Indeed, much of the work in  this area has been based on first order formative models. However, the  use of higher models is appropriate when the constructs under analysis  are of a complex nature, considering each dimension as a major component, as this enhances the construct representation and provides a  more effective assessment method ( Buil et al., 2010 ). In our case, and  following the recommendation of  Diamantopoulos and Winklhofer  (2001)  regarding \n",

              "</mark>\n",
              " and dimensionality, brand equity is  measured in accordance with four dimensions:  brand awareness, brand  associations, loyalty  and  perceived quality . The latter dimension is a  formative variable whilst the other three are reflective. In order to  measure customer loyalty and the awareness and association dimensions which for the purpose of our study were considered separately, we  adapted the scale proposed by  Yoo and Donthu (2001) , used previously  within the context of the hotel industry by  Hsu et al. (2012) . Perceived  service quality was measured on an  ad hoc  5 item scale based on elements that the hotel chain management team considered to be most  relevant in defining their service.  Perception of co-creation of value (CcV) is constructed formatively  in accordance with its four dimensions ( dialogue, access, risk and  transparency),  which were measured reflectively. Various authors have  also developed scales to operationalise its dimensions. Examples include those by  Taghizadeh et al. (2016)  or  Albinsson, Yasanthi Perera,  and Truly Sautter (2016) , who adjusted a previous version ( Albinsson,  B., &amp; Sautter, 2011 ) used by  Braz Becker and de Brito Nagel (2013)  and  which we have adapted for the purpose of our research.  There are various uni and multi-dimensional forms of measuring  customer participation (e.g.  Chan et al., 2010 ;  Chen &amp; Raab, 2017 ;  Uzkurt, 2010 ;  Yi, Nataraajan, &amp; Gong, 2011 ). In this study we have used  three dimensions ( information seeking, information sharing and responsible  behaviour)  taken from the Yi &amp; Gong scale ( 2013 ), which we consider to  be a reflective-reflective measure.  The remaining constructs, namely customer satisfaction (CS) and  perceived value (PV), are first order latent variables developed  ad hoc .  In order to measure perceived value we created two  ad hoc  items intended to reflect the trade-off between investment in terms of money,  time and effort  –  in other words the transaction value and value for  money. Overall customer satisfaction is measured by expectation disconfirmation, based on a single item scale. </div></span>"

Sample collection  White shark muscle samples were collected from May 2012 to April  2017 at the Neptune Islands Group Marine Park, South Australia (including both North and South Neptune Islands), where free-swimming  sharks were targeted opportunistically throughout the year during  standard cage-diving operations. Sharks were attracted to the cagediving vessels using a combination of attractants (bait and chum  [mixture of minced bluefin tuna head, tails, gills and guts]) ( DEWNR,  2016 ;  Huveneers &amp; Lloyd, 2017 ). Biopsies were taken from diving cages  or from above the water's surface using a single 20 mm rubber  speargun, with the end of the 1.3 m spear modified into a hollow 1 cm  diameter stainless steel biopsy probe ( Meyer, Fox, &amp; Huveneers, 2018 ),  targeting the dorsal or upper flank musculature directly below the  dorsal fin. Biopsies were immediately frozen (−4 °C) and transported to  the laboratory where white muscle tissue was dissected from the subdermal tissue and skin. Tissue samples were weighed and freeze dried  prior to lipid extraction and analysis.  Individual sharks were identified ( Nazimi, Robbins, Schilds, &amp;  Huveneers, 2018 ), sexed (based on clasper presence/absence), and  sized to the nearest 10 cm using visual size estimates ( May, Meyer,  Whitmarsh, &amp; Huveneers, 2019 ). White sharks frequenting the Neptune  Islands are identified daily by cage-diving operators, enabling to record  the date each shark was first sighted, thus marking the start of their  tourism-exposed residency period. Telemetry was not appropriate to  determine residency in this context as relatively few (n = 7) biopsied  sharks were tagged and tags might have not been deployed at the beginning of the period of tourist-exposed residency. The amount of interaction between sharks and operators or number of days sighted by  cage-diving operators could not be reliably quantified due to the logistical challenges of operators accurately recording this level of detail.  We instead conservatively used residency at the Neptune Islands, defined as the period between first day sighted and day biopsied, acknowledging the limitation of using residency as a proxy for exposure  to cage-diving operations. Where possible, sharks that had spent several  weeks or more residing at the Neptune Islands, and those for which a  biopsy was previously collected, were preferentially targeted. Additionally, biochemical data from eight white sharks caught at other  locations throughout South Australia were also obtained ( Pethybridge,  Parrish, Bruce, Young, &amp; Nichols, 2014 ). These were included in the  \n",

Residency  was grouped into two categories (&lt; 3 weeks [control] and &gt; 3 weeks [tourism-exposed] at the Neptune Islands) as shifts  in FA profiles were noted within 3 weeks of a diet switch in captive Port  Jackson sharks  Heterodontus portjacksoni  ( Beckmann, Mitchell, Seuront  et al., 2013 ).  2.2. Biochemical analysis  Total lipid was extracted from freeze dried muscle samples  (minimum 12 mg dry weight [DW]) using the modified Bligh and Dyer  method ( Bligh &amp; Dyer, 1959 ; described in detail in ( Meyer et al.,  2017 )). Briefly, the lipids were separated from proteins and carbohydrates using a solvent solution of dichloromethane, methanol, MilliQ  water. The total lipid extract (TLE) was then dried under nitrogen and  weighed prior to lipid class and FA analysis. Lipid classes [phospholipid  (PL), triacylglycerol (TAG), sterols (ST), wax esters (WE) and free fatty  acids (FFA)] were determined from an aliquot of the TLE using thin  layer chromatography coupled with a flame ionisation detector (TLCFID). Lipid class results were expressed as a relative proportion (percent  area) of the total lipid class compounds.  Individual FAs were separated from the glycerol backbones of the  polar and non-polar lipids in the TLE (not individual lipid classes) with  a heated methanol, hexane, and hydrochloric acid solvent scheme.  Subsequently, the FAs were identified and quantified using gas chromatography analysis using the Agilent Technologies 6890N GC (Palo  Alto, California, USA) with a HP-5 cross-linked methyl silicone fused  silica capillary column (50 × 0.32 mm i.d.), an FID, a splitless injector  and an Agilent Technologies 7683 Series auto-sampler. Quality checks,  including the addition of internal FA standard (C23 in each sample),  blank samples (each batch of 50), replicates (weekly) and gas chromatography - mas spectrophotometry checks on FAs (twice throughout  the analysis) were run to ensure accurate results and appropriate laboratory protocols. FA results were expressed as a proportion of the  total identified compounds. Out of the 61 fatty acids identified, only  those with means &gt; 0.1% (24) were included in the subsequent statistical analyses.  2.3. Statistical analysis  We tested the influence of tourism-exposed residency ( residency  hereafter) at the Neptune Islands on white shark muscle lipid content,  lipid class, and FA profiles using multivariate statistical analyses undertaken  in  PRIMER7  +PERMANOVA  (Plymouth  Routines  in  Multivariate Ecological Research,  Clarke &amp; Gorley, 2015 ). Permutational analysis of \n",

              " (PERMANOVA) main tests with Monte Carlo  simulations (denoted as p(MC)) were run on Bray-Curtis similarity  matrices calculated from the square-root transformed profile data to  determine if  residency  significantly influenced the overall lipid content,  lipid class, and FA profiles. The lipid and FA profiles of the eight sharks  sampled outside of the Neptune Islands were compared (using PERMANOVAs) to the control sharks (&lt; 3 weeks at the Neptune Isalnds).  Following non-significant (lipid content p(MC) = 0.847, lipid class p  (MC) = 0.617, FA p(MC) = 0.712) differences, these two groups were  combined. PERMANOVA models testing for differences between the  control (&lt; 3 weeks and sharks from outside the Neptune Islands) and  tourism-exposed sharks (&gt; 3 weeks at the Neptune Islands) included  sampling  season  to account for temporal variation in prey availability  and FA production ( Steeves et al., 2016 ) and  size  (total length) as a  continuous covariate to account for ontogenetic diet shifts ( Hussey  et al., 2012 ). Additionally, permutational analysis of multidimensional  dispersion (PERMDISP denoted at p(perm)) was used to determine the  relative amount and statistical significance of the dispersion within  residency  groups. The influence of  residency  (accounting for sampling  season  and shark  size)  was also investigated for select individual FAs  (reflecting either marine mammal or teleost consumption, or pelagic  foraging,  Table 2 ) using Generalized Linear Mixed Effect Models  (GLMMs) fitted with gamma distribution and log link using the  glm  function and restricted maximum likelihood approach in the R statistical environment ( R Core Team, 2016 ). Significance for all statistical  tests was declared at p(MC) or p(perm) &lt; 0.05.  As the 3-week threshold determined by  Beckmann et al. (2013a)  used captive Port Jackson sharks, it is uncertain whether this threshold  is directly applicable to white sharks in a natural setting. Furthermore,  Port Jackson sharks were not sampled prior to 3 weeks, so the turnover  rate may in fact be quicker. As such, all PERMANOVA and GLMM  analyses were repeated with  residency  groups &lt; 1, 1–2, 2–3, and &lt; 3  weeks; and &lt; 2 weeks (control) and &lt; 2 weeks (tourism-exposed); and  CAPs were run on these categorical  residency  groups along with the  CAPs of  residency  (days) as a continuous factor as reported below. Similarly, all GLMMs were run with  residency  as a continuous (days) or  categorical (grouped by week, and 2 week threshold as above). None of  the alternative groupings altered our findings and results from the &lt; 3  week and &lt; 3 week  residency  groupings are presented ( Fig. 1 ). To visualize and quantify shifts in lipid class and FA profiles across  residency ,  a Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) ( Anderson &amp;  Willis, 2003 ) was run against  residency  (in days) as a continuous covariate. </div></span>"

Regarding possible extensions, it seems crucial to highlight that the  TPB assumes people to be rational agents performing reasoned actions  ( Bamberg et al., 2003 ). As  Knabe (2016, pp. 1 – 256)  puts it, the TPB  “ is  based on the assumption that humans are rational beings that make systematic judgments. The theory does not account for unconscious motives. ”  Since tourism decisions require a certain level of pre-planning, information and preparation, this assumption creates less limitations in  this context than it might for other consumption choices. However, it  still means that the TPB can only grasp the targeted potential influences  to the extent that people are aware of them and are able to articulate  them objectively ( Vogel, 1997 ). With that in mind, we aimed at identifying the most influential factors on behavioural intention by using  the theoretical model in  Fig. 2 .  2.2.

Data collection  Intermediaries in the industry, such as OTAs and RS, provide a rich  database of consumer satisfaction levels, as expressed in publicly  available reviews.  The German hotel industry is characterized by a highly fragmented  market consisting mainly of small firms with limited marketing budgets. There are a total of 52,844 star-rated hotels in Germany  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). According to a study of the  German Tourism Association, 2.9 million people in Germany work in  the tourism industry, accounting for 7% of total employment and  generating 4.4% of the gross national product ( Deutscher Tourismus  Verband e.V., 2016 ).  Within the industry in Germany, domestic tourism plays an important role. In 2017, 366.4 million overnight stays in German hotels  can be traced back to German travelers, an increase of 2.8% compared  to 2015 ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). For a brief vacation, approximately three-quarters (75.2%) of Germans stay in their  own country ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ). In 2010,  Germans traveling within their own country spent 221.3 billion euros  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ), and 47% of Germans  stated that hotels are their preferred accommodation when traveling  for at least one night in Germany ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V.,  2016 ).  At the same time, German tourists claim to be interested in the  ecological and social consequences of their travels. In a \n",

              " considered the ecological sustainability of holiday travel to be  important, while 38% would like to travel in a socially sustainable  manner ( FUR Forschungsgemeinschaft Urlaub und Reisen e.V., 2014 ).  In a study from 2016, 49% of Germans stated that they would like their  holiday to be ecologically compatible, while 56% would like their  holiday to be socially compatible. Forty-four percent of German tourists  would like their holiday to be both socially and ecologically compatible  ( Deutscher Tourismus Verband e.V., 2016 ).  To assess the importance of sustainability orientation and specific  sustainability measures for tourists and to reveal possible differences,  we collected user-generated reviews for a set of selected hotels in  Germany. See  Fig. 1  for our data collection process. First, we identified  53 hotels throughout Germany that were part of a hotel corporation  engaging in sustainability management (sustainable hotels). Following  the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC), a sustainable hotel  refers to a hotel implementing measures that fall into the four main  themes: “effective sustainability planning, maximizing social and economic benefits for the local community, enhancing cultural heritage,  and reducing negative impacts to the environment” ( Global Sustainable  Tourism Council, 2016 ).  Second, we assigned a conventional hotel, e.g., a hotel that does not  explicitly engage in sustainability management, to each of the sustainable hotels that was comparable with respect to location, size  (number of rooms) and star \n",

              ".  In contrast to previous studies analyzing reviews, we collected data  from multiple platforms to account for possible systematic differences  in aggregated review scores.  Booking.com , hrs.de, tripadvisor.de, and  holidaycheck.de were selected as platforms from which to collect online  reviews. Following  Xiang, Du, Ma, and Fan (2017) , the rationale for the  selection was three-fold: 1) they are the four largest platforms for reviews in the hospitality industry in Germany ( Warnecke, 2016 ) and  thus widely used, 2) they represent the two main types of platforms  collecting reviews in the hospitality industry in Germany, i.e., OTAs  ( booking.com ,  hrs.de)  and  RS  (tripadvisor.de,  holidaycheck.de)  ( Lorenzen, 2014 ;  Warnecke, 2016 ) and 3) they have already been frequently used as primary data sources in academic literature within the  hospitality field (e.g.,  Mellinas, Martinez Maria-Dolores, &amp; Bernal  Garcia, 2015 ;  Payandeh, 2010 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ).  Guests’ ratings in reviews are a reliable indicator of customer satisfaction ( Gu &amp; Ye, 2014 ;  Hargreaves, 2012 ;  Schuckert et al., 2015 ). To  gather the review data, we developed a web crawler to visit the review  sections of the aforementioned websites for each of the selected hotels.  From March 15th to April 2nd, 2016, the crawler gathered all available  reviews at a disaggregated level including review score, title, comment  and publication date. To address the research questions properly and  ensure comparability within the set of selected hotels, we decided to  only analyze reviews written between 2014 and 2016. Consequently,  we excluded older reviews, resulting in a dataset of 59,166 reviews. For  all collected reviews, basic linguistic features such as review length  were calculated. Due to the heterogeneity among the rating subcategories assessed by the four intermediaries, we use only the overall  review score as a proxy for customer satisfaction to ensure comparability. Because the selected online platforms use different scales to  assess overall customer satisfaction, we transformed the values to a  ercentage scale for comparison. After a final check for duplicates and  missing values, 52,493 full observations remained.  3.2. \n",

              " to identify the sustainability aspects  observed and mentioned either explicitly or implicitly by a hotel guest  in an online review ( Millar &amp; Sammons, 2006 ). In this context, sustainability reflects any sustainability measure or feature of hotel management that is either implemented or absent and can refer either favorably or negatively to sustainability following the GSTC criteria for  hotels. For example, the statement “I like that they offer regional and  organic food” refers to two categories of the GSTC Criteria for Hotels: 1)  “Local purchasing” and 2) “Sustainable Purchasing”, while the statement  “Too  many  individually  packaged  items  at  breakfast—unnecessary packaging waste” refers to the category “Efficient  purchasing/reduction of unnecessary packaging”.  Unlike previous studies, we decided not to use a text analytics tool  but to assign codes manually. These tools analyze frequent words or  themes but often fail to capture uncommon but relevant aspects ( Guo  et al., 2017 ;  Xiang et al., 2017 ). By assigning codes manually, we believed we would be better able to capture the idiosyncrasies of the reviews and account for nuances. Because sustainability is a multifaceted  concept and people use many different words and descriptions to address it, it is very difficult to define pre-analysis what words hotel guests  might use when addressing sustainability aspects. Therefore, we believe  that despite the large number of reviews, in the case of sustainability, it  is a good choice to manually code the dataset to avoid the shortfalls of  text analytic tools and identify all sustainability aspects ( Geetha et al.,  2017 ).  Taking rare or infrequent words into account, we were able to reveal customer preferences. Moreover, we could capture specific guest  experiences that are uncommon but nevertheless offer a nuanced and  deeper view into the role of sustainability in online reviews and customer satisfaction.  To code the data, we used a pre-existing framework, the 27 “Global  Sustainable Tourism Criteria for Hotels and Tour Operators” developed  by the GSTC, an independent organization establishing and managing  global sustainable standards. Members include UN agencies, NGOs,  national and provincial governments, leading travel companies, hotels,  tour operators, individuals and communities ( Global Sustainable  Tourism Council, 2017 ). According to the GSTC, the criteria were developed “to provide a common understanding throughout the world of  ‘sustainable tourism’” ( Global Sustainable Tourism Council, 2017 ). A  comprehensive description of each criterion is provided by the GSTC  free of charge ( Global Sustainable Tourism Council, 2016 ).  To ensure reliability and overcome the possible biases of a single  coder procedure, we decided to follow  Lombard, Snyder-Duch, and  Bracken (2002)  and use an approach with two independent coders.  Both coders were given full access to the GSTC criteria, including  comprehensive descriptions of every code, and asked to read through  the descriptions carefully. Next, they were asked to use the descriptions  to assign codes to the reviews whenever they notice a sustainability  aspect in a review. Moreover, they were asked to distinguish between a  positive sentiment (a statement that praises either (1) the implementation of a certain sustainability measure or (2) how that measure is performed) or a negative sentiment (a statement that criticizes  (3) the absence of a sustainability measure or (4) how that measure is  performed or (5) the measure itself and/or its consequences).  Table 1  depicts coding examples for different sentiments.  To test the suitability of the selected coding scheme, both coders  initially coded a random sample of 10% of the dataset. On this basis, we  were able to expand the coding scheme to adequately capture the full  range of sustainability aspects found in the aforementioned sample. We  split the GSTC criteria category “Environmentally preferable purchasing” into two categories: food (Code 17) and other products (Code  18). We added Code 28 (Sustainability concept) because many consumers mentioned the sustainability measures of the hotel in a broad  sense, without referring explicitly to a specific “Sustainability management system” (Code 1, Sustainability management system, e.g.,  communication of certificates to guests). Because a number of people in  Germany are vegetarians/vegans, which means they do not eat meat  (vegetarians) or any animal products (vegans) ( Mensink, Lage Barbosa,  &amp; Brettschneider, 2016 ), we added Code 29 (Vegetarian/vegan food).  This code is different from the other food-related codes (17 and 13)  because it includes persons who have special needs in regard to their  food for different reasons, including ethical ones.  Furthermore, we added Code 30 (Allergies/intolerances) to account  for the rising number of people with allergies to food, dust, mold, etc.  ( Zuberbier, 2016 ). We argue that this code is relevant in providing a  safe environment, as it extends the “barrier free” concept to other aspects of the hotel. Barriers in the literal sense of restricted mobility are  considered under Code 7 (Buildings and infrastructure). The extended  coding scheme is an important tool for future research addressing  sustainability aspects in eWOM.  In a second step, both coders independently coded the full dataset  using the revised version of the coding scheme.  Fig. 1  provides an  overview of the data collection process.  3.3.

Research model  The authenticity relationships between constructs as tested in this  study are based on  Bruner (1994) ,  Cohen (1988) ,  Wang (1999) , and  Kolar and Zabkar (2010) . Authenticity is a decisive variable that affects  tourist satisfaction, and has been researched in many previous studies  ( Chhabra et al., 2003 ;  Cho, 2009 ;  Cohen, 1988 ;  Naoi, 2004 ;  Waitt,  2000 ). Precedent studies ( Kozak &amp; Rimmington, 2000 ;  Yuksel et al.,  2010 ) suggest that tourist satisfaction is a strong factor that affects  revisitation and willingness to recommend to others. Based on these  previous studies, the current study forms a multidimensional construct  of the stages of loyalty ( Back, 2005 ;  Back &amp; Parks, 2003 ;  Evanschitzky &amp;  Wunderlich, 2006 ;  Yuksel et al., 2010 ).

Phase I  Phase I investigated what type of cuisine is the most popular on  Instagram by employing the quantitative \n",

              "    <span style=\"font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem\">METHOD</span>\n",
              "</mark>\n",
              " with a specific purpose in discovering the relationship between different cuisine  types and the post popularity. Instagram was taken as reference since it  is a newly and popular tool in digital tourism ( Hanan &amp; Putit, 2014 ) and  also  one  of  the  most  popular  UGCs  among  young  generation  ( Subrahmanyam et al., 2008 ). The first step is to determine the accounts that mainly promote and share their dining experiences or opinions towards the different dish types. Keywords such as “Macau food”,  “Macau foodie” and “Macau food lover” were used. Although the high  amounts of accounts are available, the number of the followers were  significantly different by comparing the top three accounts and the rest.  Thus, only accounts having the most followers were selected to minimize any potential bias on the number of “likes”/comments. Data collection was conducted in September 2018. The first account (A1) had  27K followers with 1604 posts, the second one (A2) had 19.7K followers with 2849 posts, and the third account (A3) had 17.9K followers  with 229 posts.  The targeted images of the current study are those posted from 2017  and afterwards since Macau has been designated as the creative city of  gastronomy only from 2017. A3 was excluded because the latest post  was published in 2016. Similar to the methods applied in previous  study analyzing the Facebook usage in the case of Italy ( Mariani et al.,  2016 ), images, the date of the post, number of “likes”, comments, and  hashtags were extracted from Instagram. The total number of posts  published after 2017 from the two selected accounts were 1536 and  were all extracted for the first round of screening. At the end, there  were 597 posts considered as irrelevant to the current study due to the  three main reasons: (1) contents or images were not related to the food,  (2) check-in location was outside of Macau, and (3) contents were  mainly for promotion (e.g. poster of the restaurant containing discounts/lucky draw for users who tag their friends). Finally, it resulted  in 939 posts. Following next, according to the categories listed on the  Macau Government Tourist Office (MGTO) official website, there are  four main cuisines; namely, Macanese, Chinese, International, and local  snacks. To be more specific, sub-categories were taken into account  with a total of 15 cuisine types ( Table 1 ). All the extracted images were  categorized by two researchers respectively. Inter-coding similarity was  tested by Cohen's Kappa to evaluate whether the images were assigned  to the same category ( McHugh, 2012 ). The result reached 0.93, suggesting an excellent reliability and consistency in the coding.  3.2. Phase II  Though Phase I revealed the most popular cuisine on Instagram, it  highlights the importance and urgency to understand how the promotion should be done in a more effective and efficient manner. Thus,  Phase II explored the opinions from Macau local residents with regards  to the use of Instagram in promoting Macau's designation as a Creative  City of Gastronomy. Currently, the Macau Government Tourism Office  (MGTO) ( http://en.macaotourism.gov.mo ) serves as the public entity in  charge of implementing, analyzing and assisting in formulating the  tourism policies to enhance Macau's reputation as a high quality destination. It also plays a crucial role in promoting, coordinating or facilitating a variety of tourism projects. MGTO is putting enormous efforts in promoting the authentic and various cuisine, and a four-year  plan as one of the formal members of UNESCO Creative City of  Gastronomy was realized. However, aside from the official website, the  current online platforms used by MGTO are limited and do not include  Instagram as one of the marketing tools. Hence, Instagram was chosen  as the focus seeing its popularity in the social media networks, which  evolved the mode of communication into visualization. With the huge  benefits and potentialities Instagram brought, MGTO is strongly encouraged to create an official account. Therefore, semi-structured indepth interviews were conducted to provide insights on how Instagram  can be used in destination branding. Similar to previous literature, this  study aims to gain an understanding of the underlying opinions rather  than building theories ( Bryman, 2016 ).  A non-random, \n",

              " approach was used with a focus  on young Instagram active users. According to the report from the  Statista ( https://www.statista.com ), one of the leading providers of  market and consumer data generated from more than 22K renowned  sources, users aged from 18 to 24 and 25–34 occupied 32% and 33%  respectively worldwide in 2018. Hence, the present study targeted the  two major groups of Instagram users. Specifically, the selection criteria  are (1) Macau residents, (2) daily Instagram users, (3) users between 18  and 34, and (4) users who follow at least one Macau foodie account.  The study focuses on Macau residents since they are more familiar with  the cuisine/promotions/advertising than tourists ( Zenker et al., 2017 ).  A well-cited literature claimed that local residents should be convinced  first for any government plan since the recognition from the local  community is deemed to have influence on the success of the plan  ( Jamal &amp; Getz, 1995 ). Presuming that the MGTO is now developing an  official Instagram foodie account, if the residents are satisfied with the  performance, they are also likely to share this account or to tag their  friends and encourage them to travel to Macau and enjoy the cuisine.  Researchers approached potential participants around places nearby  the educational institutions and cafés. In any case, participants were  vetted to ensure that they met the criterion as mentioned above.  Additionally, to ensure that the interviewees are familiar with the  promotion or advertising on Instagram, only those who have already  fallowed some of the foodie accounts were invited to the \n",

              ", a multi-sample research design was applied.  Data were collected from restaurant frontline employees and customers  from large main cities in China. In particular, employees provided information of job fit, employee orientation, job satisfaction, and organizational formalization. Customers completed questions on employee  incivility. The data collection of this study was completed with 873  usable employee responses and 2,619 usable customer responses from  44 casual or fine dining restaurants. Given that the focus of this study  was on the individual-level outcomes (i.e., interpersonal interactions  between employees and customers), employee and customer responses  were combined by matching one employee with three of his or her  customers. In particular, under each employee, the mean value of three  customer responses was calculated to form the composite value of  employee incivility rated by customers. As a result, the number of observations was counted according to the number of employees, which  was 873 in total.  Stevens' (1996)  principle of 15 observations to one  observed variable was employed to estimate the minimum sample size.  There were 24 items in this study. Thus, the minimum sample size was  required to be 360. The ratio of 36 observations per variable in this  study was more than twice the recommended threshold. As  Coppola,  D'Amato, Lorenzo, and Sibillo (2009)  emphasized, scholars need to go  beyond the suggested minimum sample size.

Measures  This paper operationalized all variables in the model based on the  existing measures with minor wording modifications to fit the restaurant context. Unless otherwise noted, a seven-point Likert-type scale  was adopted, ranging from “1 = strongly disagree” to “7 = strongly  agree”. Items were coded in a way that the higher the score given, the  higher levels the variable ranked. The questionnaires were initially  compiled in English and then translated into Chinese, based on the  translation and back translation technique ( Brislin, 1980 ).  Employee orientation was measured using five items (e.g., “The  philosophy of our management emphasizes the human factor, how  people feel, etc.“), modified from  Zhang's (2010)  measurement. Job fit  was assessed using three-item  Donavan, Brown, and Mowen's (2004)  scale (e.g., “There is a good fit between my job and me”). Organizational formalization was measured based on five items (e.g., “This  restaurant has a large number of written rules and policies”), modified  from  Pugh et al.‘s (1968)  measurement. Job satisfaction was measured  using four-item  Hackman and Oldham’s (1975)  scale (e.g., “I am satisfied with working at this restaurant”). Finally, employee incivility  was assessed by customers using seven items (e.g., “The server doubted  your judgment”), modified from  Cortina, Magley, Williams, and  Langhout's (2001)  workplace incivility scale.  3.4. Data analysis  This paper employed a two-step approach to Structural Equation  Modeling (SEM) ( Anderson &amp; Gerbing, 1988 ) to analyze the collected  data. The first step was to test the measurement model. In particular,  the convergent and discriminant validity of the measurements of each  variable were examined based on Cronbach's α, composite reliability  (CR), average \n",

Stimuli and procedure  The first experimental study in this research tested the influence of  human voice on the hedonic value of the online experience, and how  this hedonic value while interacting with the hotel brand page, mediates consumers' attitudes. For the context of the study we chose a hotel  since it is a typical service in the tourism sector about which customers  search online for other people's opinions before making a reservation.  We chose Facebook as the social medium for the studies due to its  widespread adoption and relevance to business today (Snyder, 2015).  We carried out an online experimental study (between-subject design)  in order to reproduce more closely the social media environment of the  research.  Similar to  Barcelos et al. (2018) , we showed participants two versions of a fictitious hotel Facebook brand page. The use of a fictitious  brand had the objective of testing participants’ reactions to human  voice without biases from previous attitudes towards brands. Participants were asked to imagine themselves going on a trip to New York  City and looking up Facebook for opinions about a hotel named “The  Whitaker Hotel New York”. Then, they were randomly assigned with  one of the two experimental conditions. Each participant was shown  one of two versions of the hotel brand page on Facebook (i.e., using a  human or corporate voice). After looking at the page for as long as they  wished, participants responded to a \n",

              " incorporating the measures  of interest in the study.  The two versions of the hotel brand page were identical, except for  the specific manipulations on human or corporate voice. Both pages  had the same number of likes and the same review evaluation (in stars).  The differences between the versions using human or corporate voice  were inspired by previous work relating language choices and feelings  of closeness/humanness ( Fournier, 1998 ;  Park &amp; Cameron, 2014 ;  Park  &amp; Lee, 2013 ; Sela, Wheeler &amp; Sarial-Abi, 2012;  Steinmann et al., 2015 )  and consisted basically of choices of language and pictures that should  increase (vs. decrease) the perception of the brand as being more  human and close (see excerpts and general description of posts in  Appendix A ). For example, brand posts on the page using human voice  showed the profile picture of an employee, used informal language and  were occasionally signed by that employee, while brand posts on the  page using corporate voice showed the brand logo, used formal language and were signed just by the brand name. Each page had 29 posts,  11 being initiated by the brand and 18by consumers; 10 posts contained  pictures and 9 were text-only; 13 posts were primarily positive (compliments by customers or self-promotion by the hotel), 6 were primarily  negative (complaints by customers) and 10 were neutral (mostly  questions and answers). To improve realism, all posts and replies were  based on the content from the brand pages of real NYC hotels, however  with names, pictures, and personal details changed.  To improve the quality of the answers in our sample, we implemented some control measures. First, we inserted JavaScript code in  the online questionnaire allowing access only to notebooks and desktops, thus avoiding the problem of having participants look at reduced  versions of brand pages on small screens of mobile devices. Second, to  avoid using rushed answers that did not actually reflected participants’  opinions about the hotel, we inserted a hidden timer that measured how  long the participants looked at the brand pages. We discarded from the  final sample the answers of those who had not looked at the pages for at  least 15 s (16 participants).  3.1.2.

              "  In accordance with our expectations and with  Barcelos et al. (2018) ,  the brand's use of human voice on social media increased the hedonic  value of the online experience for consumers. Moreover, consumers'  attitudes were more favorable towards the hotel when it used a human  voice. The findings also show that heavy Facebook users and consumers  with higher involvement with hotels experience more hedonic value on  the brand page. The positive influence of Facebook usage intensity was  expected, since this variable represents the importance of this social  medium in people's lives. Thus, intense Facebook users should get more  hedonic value when reading brand pages, and are likely to give more  importance to the posts they read. The positive influence of the level of  enduring involvement supports the findings of  Wang et al. (2007)  on  the relationship between hedonic value, involvement, and perceived  social character of websites.  3.2. Main study  3.2.1. Stimuli and procedure  The second experimental study tested the influence of human voice  on customers’ information search on social media using eye-tracking  measures in a laboratory setting. Eye-tracking is a means to observe  user cognitive processes and to find out how specific visual features  influence eye movement ( Renshaw, Finlay, Tyfa, &amp; Ward, 2003 ). In this  sense, it not only reveals cognitive processing but also helps in detecting potentially more subtle information-salience effects. Accordingly, this study used eye-tracking to examine the influence of tone of  voice on information processing and explored the patterns of visualization on the hotel brand page.  As in the \n",

Fixations were used for two  measures: time to first fixation (how long it takes before a participant  fixates an AOI or AOI group for the first time) and total fixation duration (the sum of the duration for all fixations within an AOI or AOI  group). Longer fixations indicate more time spent processing the AOI  information or relating the component in the interface to internalized  representations ( Wedel &amp; Pieters, 2007 ). We also calculated the ratio  between the total fixation duration on AOIs and the total time on the  brand page (fixation ratio), since participants did not look at the brand  page for the same length of time, to allow further comparisons.  We also measured the number of saccades on the brand pages.  Dividing the number of saccades by the time spent on the brand page  provides the ratio of saccades per second (saccade ratio), which represents how often participants were moving their attention from one  point to the other on the screen.  Pupil size was used in this research to estimate cognitive load, following the procedures described by  Courtemanche et al. (2017) . As  with other physiological signals, pupil dilation is subject to significant  interpersonal variations or instrumental inaccuracies, so absolute values cannot be used to compare data from multiple users. Instead, these  signals need to be corrected to account for the user's baseline ( Van den  Broek, van der Zwaag, Healey, Janssen, &amp; Westerink, 2010 ). Following  the approach of  Courtemanche et al. (2017) , the results of pupil sizes  (provided by the Tobii X-60 eye-tracker) were normalized (z-scores)  using the mean and the \n",

              " of the inferred values for all  of a user's measures of pupil size. This step also helps distinguish the  “physiologically significant” areas of an interface from neutral ones. In  this approach, physiologically unimportant fixations are not considered  in the subsequent accumulation step; only important physiological activity makes a contribution ( Courtemanche et al., 2017 ). The normalized measures of pupil size were used not only for comparison between  AOIs and versions of the hotel brand page, but also for creating heat  maps, together with fixation duration.

DCC-GARCH model  The econometric framework proposed to investigate the relationship between inbound tourism demand and yield curve spreads in the  destination country is the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) model  introduced by  Engle (2002) . As part of a two-step process, first a generalised autoregressive heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model is utilised to  generate standardized residuals. These inputs form the information set  used to estimate DCC model coe ffi cients. As such, the DCC-GARCH  model avoids the computational complexities of multivariate GARCH  models given that the number of coe ffi cients estimated to generate  conditional correlation estimates does not depend on the  “ number of  series to be correlated ”  ( Engle, 2002 ).  The use of GARCH models on international tourism demand is an  increasingly common feature in the tourism literature ( Chan, Lim, &amp;  McAleer, 2005 ;  Shareef &amp; McAleer, 2005 ,  2007 ,  2008 , to list a few).  Evidence of volatility clusters along with leptokurtosis and skewness  observed with tourism demand motivates its use for the purpose of this  study ( Lorde &amp; Moore, 2008a ;  2008b ). On the other hand, the use of  GARCH models on the term structure of interest rates is motivated by  the same stylized characteristics of volatility persistence, skewness and  leptokurtosis identified by previous studies on the fixed income markets  ( Alizadeh &amp; Gabrielsen, 2013 ;  Hibbert, Pavlova, Barber, &amp; Dandapani,  2011 ). Therefore within this framework, correlation estimates ( )  being time varying, is conditional on past information denoted as  so that  . As such, this represents a stylized fact that differs from  the Constant Conditional Correlation Model of  Chang, Khamkaew,  Tansuchat and McAleer (2011 ).  Hence, the multivariate GARCH( p,q ) model for inbound tourism  demand ( d ) and the term structure of interest rates ( TSI ) of the destination country at time  t , is as follows:  (1)  where  is the vector of the data series  d  and  TSI ,  is the mean of and  denotes the vector of the error terms given the information set  . is the conditional \n",

Methodology  This inquiry is situated within a constructivist epistemology, which  holds the belief that 'there is no meaning without a mind' ( Crotty, 1998 ,  pp. 8 – 9). In this view, the meaning is constructed from the interactions  between subject and object. Studies based on constructivist epistemology shift their focus from discovering the objective truth to the  meaning-making/constructing process ( Crotty, 1998 ). Consequently,  the constructivist view that 'culture is emergent thrives and is a part of  the process' ( Bruner, 2005a , p. 161).

              ", using participant observations to gain first-hand accounts of the activities of  people under study in their natural setting ( Kawulich, 2005 ). In actual field research, researchers can observe only a few specific issues.  Neuman and Robson (2014)  suggested three types of event sampling for  selecting objects, namely, routine, special, and unanticipated. Because  our first purpose is to understand how the Shaolin culture is represented; therefore, we sampled a routine event that happens every  day (from 7:00 a.m. to around 7:00 p.m., depending on tra ffi c conditions)  –  the most-popular daily mass-tourism visits to the Shaolin  Temple. We participated in the trip as ordinary tourists and paid particular attention to how the temple was introduced by the tour guide.  Photographs were taken to record what scenery and sites were introduced. Notes were jotted down about what was elaborated on and  how the trip was arranged. As  Neuman and Robson (2014)  highlighted,  “ pouring fresh memories into the notes  …  stimulates insightful reflection ”  (p. 326). At night, we first wrote down detailed notes on the activities of the day, and then reflected on our preliminary thoughts in  analytic memos. These memos assisted in formulating our analysis after  leaving the field.  We also visited a sub-temple by hiking for nearly 3 h. Surprisingly,  this physical exercises brought us mental peace before we conducted  interviews with monks, thereby increasing our understanding of the  Shaolin culture. The remote location of this sub-temple allows it to  reduce the influence of visitors. Two monks interviewed are from this  sub-temple. The interviews with three monks and a nun, not only added  a novelty value to our study; but also provided insight from the devout  Buddhist perspective on what Shaolin culture is and how it should be  represented. In total, 543 photographs were taken in our field work,  and later helped with recalling events during writing. Part of our participant-\n",

              " was also  used to expand our local network. A Buddhist contact, who was a local  resident and had worked in the tourism industry for 20 years, generously helped us to reach out to local organisations that were active in  representing the temple. Some of them introduced other interviewee to  us as well, the so called  “ snowball ”  effect. Finally, sixteen members of  DMOs were invited to participate in in-depth interviews: four from  travel agencies, five from different levels of tourism administrations  (i.e. county, municipal, and provincial), two from Buddhism-themed  hotels, one from the management company of Songshan Scenic Attraction, one from the main temple, and three from sub-temples (see  Table 1 ). Two interviews were conducted after our field trip: one via  audio call and another via WeChat messages.  Tse (2016)  defined destination marketing organisations (DMOs) as  stakeholders, such as travel agents, hotels, governments, and attractions, who make the  “ effort to get people to visit the destination ”  (p.248). All the four types of stakeholders are included in our study. In  the Shaolin case, the tourism administration, as non-for-profits entities,  set up a specific marketing division to formulate o ffi cial-promotional  texts and lead campaigns for attractions within their territory, including, but not limited to the Shaolin Temple. The reputation of the  temple makes it a focal point of all three levels of administration. Travel  agencies and hotels introduce information about the temple with the  particular purpose of promoting their own services to visitors. The  temple itself is the attraction and has its own channels to spread information to its followers and the general public. Doubtless, coordination and cooperation among these stakeholders are necessary. For instance, some promotional events, such as the Shaolin International  Martial Arts Festival, are co-hosted by all the stakeholders.  Since the Tang Dynasty, the Shaolin Temple has included a number  of temples within and outside of Henan province as its sub-temples ( Su,  2016 ). The internal management of the temple is similar to a  ‘ family  structure ’ , which ensures that different sub-temples share the same  disciplines ( Su, 2016 ) and that monks and nuns are collectively deployed. The abbot of the main temple makes decisions about assigning  abbots, monks, and nuns, and provides different types of support for  sub-temples, such as renovation or funds. The sub-temples hold the flexibility of its own management, including setting up its own social  media channel to connect with its followers and deciding its own visiting policy.  Most participants were in charge of marketing and managing and  had extensive experience  –  more than ten years for twelve out of the  sixteen. For instance, four participants from travel agencies had been in  managerial positions for ten years, and all of them had worked as tour  guides who led groups around the temple for another ten years. Similar  rich backgrounds of experience were also notable in the government  o ffi cers. Two o ffi cers from the provincial government had worked in  the promotion of the provincial attractions for more than 30 years.  Moreover, they had worked in representing the temple almost since its  opening to tourists. Shaolin Temple is located in the Dengfeng County  of Zhengzhou Municipal City in Henan Province. With respect to the  managerial bureaus, we deliberately engaged with participants from  different levels. For example, among the five governmental o ffi cers, two  were from the provincial level, one was from the municipal level, and  two were from the county level. In addition to the monks, two other  participants were Buddhists.  Denzin and Lincoln (1998)  emphasised that one important criteria  for selecting participants is their willingness to share their genuine  opinions with the researcher. Some of our participants provided as  much information as they could because of their years-long partner  relationship with our local contact and the belief that discussing  Shaolin Temple issues in academic circles is also a way to promote it.  These factors enabled us to extend the discussion in depth, and the  average \n",

As  Parry and Johnson (2007)  noted, studies based on the post-positivism  paradigm tend to  ‘ de-contextualise, distil and otherwise simplify ’  (p.  120) research, whereas other research works contextualise and encompass the complexity. Therefore, we used more notes, questions, and  original sentences than a simple and brief code (or concept) in our  analysis. Those diverse labels broadly served to facilitate the authors'  thinking. The analysis process was facilitated by the qualitative analysis  software, Quirkos 1.5. Specifically, the software assisted the analysis in  three ways: marking and notes; searching on specific topics or notes;  and cooperation and communication with authors who are physically  located in different countries. For instance, the team could easily go  back to Chinese transcripts while preparing this English manuscript.  This means that the English writing has been compared with original  Chinese transcripts several times and by different authors, which increases the accuracy of our translations. Throughout the whole process,  the authors, not the software, directed the analysis.  Reliability and validity, which are the criteria of assessing positivist  research, are respectively replaced by trustworthiness and authenticity  in qualitative inquiry ( Altheide &amp; Johnson, 2011 ;  Lincoln, Lynham, &amp;  Cuba, 2011 ;  Neuman &amp; Robson, 2014 ).

Methodology  Consumer choice among a set of finite and discrete alternatives is  modeled typically under the random utility maximization (RUM)  paradigm. In particular, the utility derived by individual  n  for alternative  i  is specified as follows:  (1)  where  V  represents the observed part of the utility captured by a linear  combination of coe ffi cients  β  associated with  k  attributes  x  and  ε refers to the error term representing the unobserved part of the utility  assumed to be independent and identically distributed ( iid ) following  an extreme value distribution. Under the RUM paradigm, individuals  are expected to select the alternative  i  that maximizes their utility.  Considering that only part of the utility is observed, individual choices  can be predicted only up to a probability. Therefore, the probability  that  individual  n  chooses  alternative  i  is  equal  to  . Given the distributional assumption of the error term, the multinomial logit (MNL) choice probability  for a RUM model is computed conveniently as follows:  (2)  As previously discussed, the RRM paradigm is considered as an alternative decision rule assuming that individuals minimize the anticipated regret when selecting between alternatives ( Chorus et al., 2008 ).  Here, regret is intended as what the individual experiences when an  unchosen alternative performs better than the chosen one ( Chorus,  2010 ). Therefore, the assumption is that consumers aim to avoid regret  rather than seek utility when choosing among different products. Formally, the anticipated regret experienced by individual  n  for alternative  i  is specified as follows:  (3)  where  R  represents the observed regret,  β  refers to the coe ffi cient  associated with attribute  x , and  x  and  x  are the values of the attribute  k  for the considered alternative  i  and another alternative  j . The  unobserved regret is captured by the error term with its negative following an  iid  extreme value distribution. As indicated in the regret  function, a pairwise comparison is made for each attribute  k  between its  level in the considered alternative  i  and in any other alternative  j  in the  choice set. A close inspection of the utility and regret functions suggests  a fundamental conceptual difference in the decision-making process  assumed in the two approaches. In the utility-based approach, the individual is assumed to assess alternatives separately by attaching a  weight to each alternative attribute. The utility values, which are derived through summation, are then compared, and the alternative with  the highest value is selected. Therefore, the comparison between alternatives takes place at the aggregate level, making RUM models fully  compensatory. That is, a decrease in one alternative attribute can be  offset fully by an equal increase in another equally important attribute.  In the regret-based approach, the individual is assumed to assess alternatives collectively by attaching a weight to the differences between  attributes across all alternatives. The overall regret is obtained through  summation, and the alternative with the lowest value is selected.  Therefore, the alternatives are compared at both attribute and aggregate levels, making the RRM model semi-compensatory. That is, the  level of compensation needed to offset a decrease in one alternative  attribute depends on the relative performance of the attribute compared to the other alternatives.  Under the RRM paradigm, the probability that individual  n  selects  alternative  i  is  equal  to  .  Mathematically, minimizing the regret is equivalent to maximizing the  negative regret ( Chorus, 2010 ). Hence, the same probability can be  rewritten as  . Considering  the distributional assumption of the negative error, the MNL choice  probability of an RRM model can be computed conveniently as follows:  (4)  The extension of the MNL choice probabilities to account for  random preference heterogeneity and panel structure of the data (i.e.,  correlation across choice tasks for the same respondent) is straightforward, leading to the so-called mixed logit (MXL) probabilities ( Train,  2009 ). The MXL choice probabilities for the RUM and RRM models,  respectively, are specified as follows:  (5)  (6)  where  s  = 1,  … ,  S  refers to the choice tasks per respondent, and  f( β )  is a  density function typically specified to follow a normal distribution. The  integrals in equations  (5) and (6)  have no close form, and the choice  probability for MXL models are approximated through simulation. As  shown in the equations above, the MNL-RRM and MXL-RRM models  share the same type of choice probabilities of the MNL-RUM and MXLRUM models. This characteristic makes the RRM class of models easy to  estimate through maximum (simulated) likelihood estimator commonly  used in software packages for \n",

              ". In fact, investigation of the RRM models is reported in a growing number of  applications in several contexts, including transport mode choice ( Boeri  and Masiero, 2014 ;  Chorus, 2010 ;  Hensher et al., 2016 ;  Hess &amp;  Stathopoulos, 2013 ;  Leong &amp; Hensher, 2015 ), shopping-center choice  ( Chorus, 2010 ;  Rasouli &amp; Timmermans, 2017 ) outdoor recreation site  choice ( Boeri, Longo, Doherty, &amp; Hynes, 2012 ;  Thiene, Boeri, &amp; Chorus,  2012 ), and leisure activities ( Dekker, Hess, Arentze, &amp; Chorus, 2014 ).  Chorus, Rose, and Hensher (2013)  introduced a hybrid model specification where attributes are processed according to either utility-based  or regret-based decision rules.  Chorus, van Cranenburgh, and Dekker  (2014)  provide a comprehensive review of 43 empirical comparisons  between RUM and RRM models that appeared in 21 articles. Their  analysis shows quite clearly the absence of a dominant approach in  terms of model fit because 13 comparisons resulted in a statistical tie,  15 in favor of RUM model and 15 in favor of RRM model.  The RUM model has solid microeconomics foundation that facilitates the derivation of compensation measures, such as the marginal  rate of substitution (MRS), defined as the ratio of two marginal utilities  (  ). If one of the two marginal  utilities is associated with a monetary attribute (typically price), the  marginal rate of substitution is interpreted as the very useful and  popular WTP measure (  ). In the RRM model, the  derivation of the MRS lacks theoretical support of the microeconomics  axiom ( Chorus, 2012 ). However, it is possible to compute the MRS (or  WTP) counterpart for an RRM model, although the derivation is less  straightforward than for a RUM model because of the semi-compensatory nature of the RRM approach. As discussed in  Chorus (2012) , the  RRM counterpart of the MRS is derived as follows:  (7)  Therefore, the MRS (and WTP where  y  refers to the price attribute  and  β  =  –  β ) counterpart for an RRM model is not a single constant  as in the linear RUM model but varies based on the attribute levels in  the chosen and unchosen alternatives in the choice set. In particular,  high (low) values of MRS  are expected when the chosen alternative performs relatively worse (better) than the unchosen alternatives. This argument is an intuitive one and reflects the behavioral  appeal of the RRM semi-compensatory paradigm.  Chorus et al. (2013)  provide a comprehensive comparison of WTP measures derived from  attributes processed under different decision rules, being utility-based,  regret-based, or a combination of the two.  The following section proposes a comparison between RUM and  RRM approaches regarding MNL and MXL models. Willingness to pay  measures derived from the MNL models are further illustrated and  discussed in terms of practical implications. </div></span>"

Design, sample, and procedures  The study employed a one-factor, lab-coordinated experimental  design on a sample of 279 students, faculty, and staff from a large  Midwestern university who in return for their participation received  Amazon Gift Cards as incentives. Over the course of five weeks, participants were randomly assigned to one of three presentations of an  extended-stay hotel suite that differed in preview interactivity: static  images vs. 360° tour vs. VR. Participants’ age range was 18–69 years old  (M = 23.02). Approximately 33% of participants were male, 75.9%  were Caucasian, and 48.7% earned more than $49,999 annually. When  asked about prior hotel experience, 94.6% reported that they spend  minimum one night a year in hotels and 37.3% have had prior experience with extended-stay hotels. In addition, participants reported  prior experience with computer generated images (79.6%), 360° tours  (76.7%), and VR (35.1%). Those who previously tried VR devices had  experience with Samsung Gear and Sony Playstation VR (see  Appendix  A  and  Appendix B  for detailed demographics).  Upon arrival to the computer lab, participants received an informed  consent explaining the study procedures, risks, benefits, incentives, and  screening questions (i.e., Are you at least 18 years old?; Do you experience migraines, headaches, seizures, or other symptoms triggered  by flashing or flickering lights?; Do you frequently experience motion  sickness (dizziness, light-headedness, and nausea)?; Have you ever experienced cyber sickness (dizziness, light-headedness, and nausea) after  spending time in virtual environments?).

A virtual environment of the hotel suite was created using 3D Studio Max architectural modeling software and Unreal video game development engine. Participants in the 360° tour condition reviewed a web-based tour  of the same space with 360° field of view, presented on a laptop screen.  In the VR condition, participants saw the same hotel suite environment  via an HTC Vive headset VR device. The HTC Vive device has a high  field of view screen and is capable of head and motion tracking. Prior to  reviewing the hotel suite, the participants received a brief demonstration of the device controls and navigation through the VR environment  from the researcher. To maintain consistency across the conditions and  minimize the researcher bias, participants in the first two conditions  were instructed how to navigate through static images and 360° tour by  the same researcher. All verbal communication with the participants  followed a scripted dialogue and pertained to the explanation of the  study procedures and navigation through each of the three preview  modes. After providing the explanation, the researcher did not interfere  with the way participants explored the preview. The preview duration  across conditions did not have a significant effect on the levels of brand  experience ( Roy's Largest Root  = 0.021,  F (4,271) = 1.412,  p  = .230).

The Delphi process requires iteration of group conversation until consensus is reached, and is  characterised by a feedback-loop of information exchange where purposely selected participants are given rounds of tasks to complete  ( Linstone &amp; Turoff, 2002 ). It is a staged process where, on completion of  each task, responses are amalgamated, and the combined results are  returned to participants. Each round of tasks provides the participants  with the opportunity to reflect on and reassess their previous contributions until desired objectives are achieved ( Hsu &amp; Sandford, 2007 ).  Relatively small and not overly heterogenic panels are thought to be  able to ‘dig deeper’ into issues explored, because relatively large and  heterogenic panel composition bears a risk of only being able to agree  on trivial and non-relevant points as opinions and perspectives may  diverge too much ( Baker, Lovell, &amp; Harris, 2006 ).

Past methodological critiques for the  Delphi approach included the validity, reliability and trustworthiness of  study results ( Woudenberg, 1991 ). For example, high rates of panel  attrition may occur as participants drop out during the course of a study  ( Garrod &amp; Fyall, 2005 ). High attrition rates may seriously call their  quality and significance into question when the reduced panel is biased  in a systematic way ( Garrod, 2012 ). Moreover,  Hasson and Keeney  (2011)  explain that modifications of the Delphi technique to accommodate for different research problems can be associated with discrepancies in design and implementation, associated with high levels of  personal and situation specific bias present in many studies.

A Delphi approach to  data collection creates an opportunity to repeatedly engage with multiple stakeholders who are spatially and/or hierarchically dispersed  ( Northcote, Lee, Chock, &amp; Wegner, 2008 ), and given that the tourism  industry is “characterised by fragmentation and limited opportunities  for interaction and knowledge exchange” ( Donohoe &amp; Needham, 2009 ,  p. 420), the Delphi technique particularly appropriate.

Critical  design decisions include a clear definition of expertise, including the  declaration of the expert selection criteria and the sampling method  ( Baker et al., 2006 ). For example, expertise can be defined by one's  knowledge and extent of experience, which is often linked to a professional qualification and the length of involvement with the problem  or issue at hand ( Baker et al., 2006 ), but may also be influenced by a  person's reputation, age, or culture if relevant to a particular research  question ( Day &amp; Bobeva, 2005 ).

Fig. 1  details the stages and  tasks adopted in the current study.  In order to answer the research questions, expertise in this study  was defined by a person's knowledge and experience in relation to  visitor risk management issues in protected areas in Australia. Protected  areas in Australia are governed by both federal and state legislation,  and to populate the expert panel, each state agency responsible for the  management and governance of protected areas (i.e. usually the Parks  and Wildlife Service of each state) as well as the federal body overseeing national parks of specific commonwealth importance (i.e. Parks  Australia) were invited to participate (see  Fig. 2 ). The selection criteria  required Delphi participants to be:  (1) Currently be employed by any Australian protected area management agency for at least 5 years;  (2) Currently be or have been heavily involved in the management of  visitor risk within protected areas and nature reserves as part of  their professional role within this agency; and to  (3) Have a great understanding of the wide variety of natural landscape  forms, the variety of different environmental hazards posing risks to  visitors, and the various ways visitor risks are managed at different  visitor sites within their tenures.  For the current study a panel size of about 20 members was determined as being appropriate, following recommendations of  Baker  et al. (2006)  and  Okuli and Pawlowski (2004) . In order to capture the  various geographical differences and consequently a variety of different  approaches to manage visitor risk in protected areas, each agency was  requested to propose a minimum of two (and a maximum of four) research participants based upon the expertise criteria specified above.  The final Delphi panel consisted of twenty-two ( N  = 22) VRM professionals from seven agencies. The geographical and organisational distribution of the panel is detailed in  Fig. 2 .  For this Delphi process, the criteria specified at the beginning of the  study included that the panel: (1) should comprise at least 50% of the  total panel size, and (2) should comprise at least one participant from  each participating agency. If one of these panel criteria were no longer  met, the study would be terminated (see  Garrod &amp; Fyall, 2005 ;  Donohoe  &amp; Needham, 2009 ;  Garrod, 2012 ).  3.3. Delphi rounds  3.3.1. Round 1: Scoping questions  The first round of the Delphi was explorative in nature (see  Donohoe, 2011 ) and was designed to obtain participants' reflections on  VRM issues and responsibility for safety in protected areas. An email  was sent to participants, asking for response to following questions:  (1) Who do you think is responsible for visitor safety in protected areas,  and why?  (2) Supposing responsibilities are shared between land managers and  visitors, do you think that responsibility-sharing levels of each party  might be different at various areas within your state? Why?  The email reiterated that individual responses would be utilised in a  summarised format to inform subsequent email rounds. Responses to  Round 1 were received from 20 participants (91%), with individual  response length ranging between 111 and 3027 words. Responses to the  questions were uploaded to QSR*NVIVO11 to classify, sort and arrange  data. Using the guidelines proposed by  Brady (2015) , \n",

Round 2 - Task 1: Responsibility for visitor safety  In relation to the first research question, the responses to Round 1  were examined and stakeholder responsibility was identified. The rationale for stakeholder responsibility was also recorded. A summary of  responses was provided to the panel for further refinement. Round 2 Task 1 responses were received from 16 experts (73%). Six agreed to  the information as collated without any changes, and ten panel members agreed with minor wording modifications. Consensus to the first  research question was achieved with results provided in section  4.1  of  this article.  3.3.3. Round 2 - Task 2: Responsibility-sharing across visitation contexts  Round 1 responses were re-examined for the second research  question with the intention of defining how site attributes may influence the responsibility-sharing expectations. Conceptual labels were  attached to individual responses, generally on a phrase or sentence  basis, and categorised. Thirty site attributes were identified that influenced differences in responsibility-sharing in protected areas, which  were grouped into six themes (for a more detailed description of this  process see section  4.2  of this article).  The attribute groups were provided to Delphi panellists for further  evaluation. Here, panel members were asked to reflect on each attribute  based on their importance within responsibility-sharing considerations  and how it would differ across different setting types (i.e. highly  managed, moderately managed, or marginally managed for visitor  risk). Responses to Round 2 - Task 2 were received from 16 panel  members ( 73% ).  3.3.4. Round 3  Responses to Round 2 - Task 2 were analysed applying thematic  coding principles to conceptually understand response patterns ( Brady,  2015 ), also numerically coding attribute importance expressed by panellists. A summary table was created for participants to review in  Delphi Round 3, which included a brief explanation how the themes  were extracted and how it forms part of VRM processes as guided by the  Australian Standard AS/NZS 31000:2009 Risk Management: Principles  and Guidelines  (i.e. defining the risk management context).  Responses to Delphi Round 3 were received from a total of 12 panellists (55%). Of those, 11 approved the themes and suggested minor  alterations of wording to improve clarity. One panellist was reluctant to  comment on Round 3 and noted that he  had expected a more diverse  application that shared responsibility amongst land managers, tour operators, promotors and the visitors themselves.

As a result, 36 (4 × 9) term combinations were searched in  the databases.  The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and  Meta-Analyses) flowchart adapted from  Moher et al. (2010)  was  adopted with some modifications to facilitate the efficiency of the  searching process (see  Fig. 2 ). The 36 keyword combinations were  firstly searched in Google Scholar. Specifically, the combinations containing  authenticity  were searched first, followed by  otherness ,  othering  and  othered . The above procedure was repeated in another seven databases (i.e. Scopus, EBSCO Host, Science Direct, Emerald, Web of  Science, ProQuest and Sage) and constant comparisons across the databases were conducted to avoid duplicates. It was expected that the  number of records identified in the additional seven databases was  decreasing at this stage because most of the records had been found by  Google Scholar. These subsequent seven databases therefore acted as a  reinforcing measure to make certain no records were missed during the  searching process in Google Scholar. As of December 2017, this multiple-comparison process identified 269 records, which were exported  to Endnote software for data management. 28 non-full-text records  excluded in the identification phase consisted of books, book chapters,  conference papers, journal articles and duplicates retrieved from  different online sources. After removing the non-full-text records, the  remaining 241 records were screened against the selection criteria,  where non-journal publications were excluded. The exclusion of nonjournal publications has been a regular occurrence in systematic reviews ( Kim &amp; Cuskelly, 2017 ;  Thomson et al., 2018 ;  Yang et al., 2017 ).  The screening process resulted in 102 eligible full-text records included in the final analysis. After a closer examination of the full texts, a  further 17 records were justifiably discarded. The most common reasons for exclusion were the irrelevant focus concerning authenticity in  dining experiences and authenticity as research implications and suggestions for future research. For instance,  Muniz, Harrington, Ogbeidea,  and Seo (2017)  examines the influence of background sounds and music  on arousal and avoidance behaviours on ethnic menu item selection and  price expectations. Although the ethnic dining setting suggests the existent role of authenticity in this article, its focus is not on how these  examined elements shape perceptions of authenticity, but how they  influence dish selection and price expectation. Another example was by  Vásquez and Chik (2015) , who argue that foodies use online reviews as  a means through which individuals can display their culinary capital to  an audience, as they establish their expertise in certain matters (e.g.  authenticity, taste, quality, and the perceived value of their dining  experiences). Although restaurants’ authenticity is mentioned in this  article, this concept is approached as a mean for online reviewers to  demonstrate their culinary expertise, not to contribute to the overall  dining experience ( Vásquez &amp; Chik, 2015 ), thus this article was also  excluded from the synthesis.  As a result, 85 articles were considered as eligible, and the reference  lists of these articles were cross-checked to identify if there were any  additional records overlooked. The list of 85 selected articles is documented in  Appendix A . These texts were then quantitatively assessed,  categorised and structured so as to offer a comprehensive picture of  authenticity literature in the context of dining experiences. It is acknowledged that the coding and categorisation performed in the review  process were subject to the researchers’ linguistic background and interpretations. As a result, to minimise such effects, the coding and categorisation were conducted and revised after entering the first 10% of  articles ( Pickering &amp; Byrne, 2014 ;  Yang et al., 2017 ). The categories  were then tested and revised for each subsequent 10% of articles entered until the 85 articles were all coded and categorised. Also, to ensure consistency in the coding and categorisation, the categories were  cross-checked among the research team which consists of one Asian and  three native English speaker researchers. Several aspects of each article  were extracted and presented in the synthesis: (1) key academic disciplines interested in authenticity studies and research contexts; (2)  research methods, samplings and approaches; (3) key concepts investigated in the literature in consideration of the presence of theoretical foundations; (4) the relationships reported between authenticity  and  other  concepts;  and  (5)  emerging  dimensions  informing  authenticity in dining experiences. The descriptive findings are presented as tables and figures and discussed throughout the next section,  with the summary of key review findings and the discussion of research  directions in the subsequent section. </div></span>"
