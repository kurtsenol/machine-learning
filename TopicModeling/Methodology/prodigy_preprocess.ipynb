The main purpose of the paper is to discuss the approach of Polish Destination Management Organisations co-creation of tourism experience with the use of ICT on the example of Małopolska Voivodeship, Poland. The approach of Destination Management Organisations to digital tourism marketing should be based on the awareness of both the potential of ICT-based tools and the context they operate in. ICT-related solutions implemented by Destination Management Organisations have to be matched to the ICT infrastructure that exists at the destination or region and the needs of tourists who visit the area. The co-creation of tourism experience is beneficial both for Destination Management Organisations and tourists, but this approach should only be applied when both sides are ready to cooperate. ;;'"

The main purpose of the paper is to discuss the approach of Polish Destination Management Organisations co-creation of tourism experience with the use of ICT on the example of Maopolska Voivodeship, Poland. The approach of Destination Management Organisations to digital tourism marketing should be based on the awareness of both the potential of ICT-based tools and the context they operate in. ICT-related solutions implemented by Destination Management Organisations have to be matched to the ICT infrastructure that exists at the destination or region and the needs of tourists who visit the area. The co-creation of tourism experience is beneficial both for Destination Management Organisations and tourists, but this approach should only be applied when both sides are ready to cooperate.',\n",
              "       'Research on sustainability in tourism has increasingly focused on environmental and economic  rather than social  sustainability, especially in its practical applications. This case study of responsible tourism in Kumarakom, India, contributes to the growing body of literature on social sustainability, following a qualitative research design adopting both method and data triangulation. This includes field visits, interviews, and document analysis. The findings demonstrate the exceptional level of community participation and satisfaction at Kumarakom. This has been achieved through the continuous support, coordination, and collaboration of various stakeholders and strong, efficient government support. Moreover, the results highlight the significance of gender equality and womens empowerment as integral elements of social sustainability. This study contributes to the development of tourism theory and governance by demonstrating how the substantive and procedural aspects of social sustainability intertwine with its broader potential as a channel for communication; furthermore, it aims to play a constructive role in the larger debate on sustainability following the establishment of a thriving market.',\n",

              "       'The relationship between museums and sustainability has been interpreted in terms of the functioning of museums as an institution and the role of museums in sustainable development. These two assessments are also considered as a whole for the sustainability of the museums. Studies on museums and sustainability focused on the social, environmental and economic practices of museums in sustainable development, and the methods used by museums in these practices or how to raise awareness on this issue in the society were questioned. Among these studies, the contribution of museums to environmental sustainability has taken its place among the most discussed topics. However, the fact that museums are institutions that collect, preserve, research, share, exhibit and transmit tangible and intangible cultural heritage shows that the cultural aspect of sustainable development should also be evaluated in terms of museums. Therefore, the article focuses on the cultural aspect of sustainable development, and this context is interpreted as a main topic for museums that should not be attached to the social, environmental and economic aspects of sustainability, but should also be examined and investigated in terms of its consequences. In this respect, firstly, the relationship between museum and sustainability is emphasized and the meanings of sustainability for museums is discussed. Later, from the first definition of sustainable development in the Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future report published by the United Nations in 1987, to the announcement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the process is evaluated in terms of the practices of museums in this field and approaches in museums. After 2015 the management of the museum, the museum building, attention was directed towards sustainable development objectives until the effectiveness of the functions shall be resolved through examples in the world and Turkey. In addition, it will be mentioned how these goals can be implemented both in the functioning of museums and in the daily life of the society, and the cultural aspect of sustainability. Three different definitions of cultural sustainability are given and based on these definitions, it is discussed which definition of cultural sustainability the museums accept. For the definition of cultural sustainability of museums, the importance of interpreting together the Convention for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage adopted in 2003 by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, whose short name is UNESCO, the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions adopted in 2005, and sustainable development are mentioned. In this way, it is explained how museums can create cultural strategies in order to safeguard the intangible cultural heritage alive from generation to generation, continuously recreate it, protect and maintain cultural diversity, develop intercultural dialogue and, create spaces for communities to safeguard their cultural heritage. The role played by participation and transmission in museums in sustainability, as it places people at the focal point, is highlighted and the practices of museums related to cultural sustainability are evaluated with examples. Finally, the use of areas such as cultural tourism, cultural industry or urban creativity by museums, which are directly addressed in terms of economic development but also require examination in terms of cultural sustainability, are emphasized.',\n",
              "       'In China, the topics of pandemic and economic recovery gradually lose their importance and give place to another deterioration in U.S.-China relations due to pressure from the United States on Hong Kong, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region, and the insufficient, according to the American side, pace of implementation of Chinas first phase of commercial transactions with the United States. Beijing takes Washingtons threats to deprive Hong Kong of the status of a special customs territory in trade and economic cooperation with the U.S. quite seriously. However, Chinese experts note that the implementation of these threats will not lead to the collapse of the Hong Kong economy, since the most-favored-nation regime applies to about 5% of Hong Kongs exports to the United States. At the same time, Beijing is trying to find an alternative to Hong Kong as a financial center in the face of Macao. However, the main characteristics of the Macao economy do not yet allow us to seriously talk about a full-fledged replacement, since most of the GDP of this special administrative region is formed by the gaming, tourism and restaurant industries. To a certain extent, the position of Hong Kong is claimed by Shanghai, but the extent of its claims is limited by the Chinese legal system, which is less flexible and liberal than that of Hong Kong. In May 2020, the so-called Two sessions were held in Beijing: the national Committee of the Peoples Political Consultative Council of China (CPPCC) and the National Peoples Congress (NPC). The latter presented a report on the governments work in 2019 and the first quarters of 2020. The report contains the main guidelines and targets for the countrys socio-economic development for the current year, as well as a list of measures to support the economy in the so-called post-crisis period. Most of the mechanisms for stimulating growth are of a fiscal nature: the authorities do not want to inflate the amount of debt owed by public and private companies too much, and they go, first of all, for tax breaks. At the same time, the Central budget deficit is expected to increase to 3.6% due to reduced tax revenues because of quarantine measures and increased government spending to support consumer demand. At the same time, Beijing announced a reduction in spending by the central and provincial governments on unimportant and non-priority items: construction of buildings, business trips, celebrations, etc. The report on the governments work reflected the desire of the Chinese leadership to accelerate the ongoing work on launching a new economic model of Chinas development, aimed not at achieving high growth rates, but at quality indicators. For the first time, the NPC session did not specify the expected GDP growth rate in 2020. However, the main characteristics of this model have not yet been fully clarified. In the first approximation, it is a bet on the production of high-tech products, the implementation of traditional infrastructure projects within China and the expansion of domestic consumption - while maintaining the strategy of going outside in the format of the Belt and Road (or the Silk Road Economic Belt). The so-called separation of China and the United States in the financial and economic spheres, which is widely discussed in the world press, has not yet taken place. D. Trumps return of American business to the United States is not yet perceived by the American private business itself, which is interested in expanding its presence in Chinese financial and other markets. China, for its part, by opening previously closed sectors of its economy is trying to provide new business opportunities to American companies in a compromise way, in contrast to military and political issues, where Beijing acts extremely harshly. In Russian-Chinese relations, there is still a trend to deepen strategic partnership in the military-political sphere and, if possible, in the economy - taking into account the negative consequences of the pandemic and adjusting for the scale of the Russian economy.',\n",
              "       'The growth in demand for air transport as well as budget constraints have put pressure on airport development. Therefore, airports worldwide need to become financially self-reliant and obtain better managerial tools to improve airport efficiency. Business models and business model innovations have proven to have positive impacts on airport performance (Alfuah, 2019; Zott & Amitt, 2007). However, studies relating to airport business models are scarce and lack scholarly attention, especially in the context of small airports (Adler, lk & Yazhemsky, 2013). Consequently, the goal of this dissertation is to design business models and propose business model innovations using a case study of local and regional airports in Thailand to fill up the paucity of knowledge in the literature. Objectives The research objectives are as follows: To analyse the situation of local and regional airports in Thailand at both the industry level and firm level To determine the factors affecting airport technical efficiency To develop a framework for designing local and regional airport business models To design airport business models and propose business model innovations for local and regional airports in Thailand Methodology The Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal (PESTEL) Analysis and Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) were incorporated under the structureconductperformance paradigm to analyse the local and regional airport industry. Simultaneously, the output-oriented data development analysis (DEA) developed by Banker, Charnes and Cooper (1984) or the BCC-DEA model was employed to analyse the firm-level situation, reflecting the technical efficiency scores of 28 local and regional airports under the operations of the Department of Airports (DOA). The computed technical efficiency scores classified the airports into three strategic groups: the average group, below-average group and above-average group. Due to time and budget limitations, 3 of the 28 local and regional airports were selected based on the negative trends of their technical efficiency scores. In other words, Suratthani International Airport, Lampang Airport and Ubon Ratchathani International Airport were chosen to represent each strategic group of DOA airports: the average group, below-average group and above-average group, respectively. The Panel Least Square method was used to regress the secondary data during the 20142018 fiscal years, as this method is purposive for examining airport technical efficiency determinants. The airport ownership forms, service-relating policies and airport revenues acted as regressors, while the dependent variable was from the technical efficiency scores computed from the BCC-model in the first stage. The exploratory and documentary research were integrated to formulate the framework that would be useful in designing airport business models. Using the semi-structured questionnaire developed under the Business Model Canvas (BMC) of Osterwalder and Pigneur (2010), nine key informants of airport management were identified. For the documentary research, this study investigated the lessons learnt from the worlds best airport, Singapore Changi International Airport, and the worlds best regional airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, according to Skytrax. Several related documents, such as annual reports and information from the airport newsroom, were collected.Qualitative analysis was employed in the final stage. Thirty-six key informants, both local and regional, from several airport stakeholders, including airlines, passengers, ramp operators and airport scholars, were questioned via in-depth interviews using a semi-structured questionnaire. The insightful information gleaned from stakeholders led to suggestions of proposed airport business models from which the innovation development concept was introduced. The discussions surrounding current local and regional airport business models and the lessons learnt from best practice airports provided the gap for innovating the business models. Results The PESTEL-AHP model revealed that the Air Navigation Act (No.14) BE 2562 was the strongest component, significantly impacting the overall industry by approximately 28% and shaping how DOA airports ran their businesses as a public agency. The other top 2 PESTEL elements were noted as the (1) National Strategy (20182037) and the (2) trend toward airport digitalisation with a pairwise estimate at 22% and 21%, respectively. For the firm-level situation analysis, the BCC-DEA model confirmed that 28 local and regional airports were technically inefficient, showing an average technical efficiency score equal to 0.188. To understand the source of technical inefficiency of local and regional airports, the econometric model reported that airport ownership patterns were found to be the most significant factors affecting technical efficiency; service-relating policies and total airport revenues also played a significant part in airport efficiency. The lessons learnt from the worlds best airports and the in-depth interviews from airport management suggest that the framework for designing business models should focus on the sustainability of an airport. Although the BMC gave a good depiction of overall airport operations, the issues relevant to sustainability should have greater awareness. Moreover, the lessons learnt revealed that a paradigm shift was undertaken by world airport business administrations to increase revenues, and best practice airports developed themselves as tourist destinations. Several key activities and value propositions were dedicated to various customer segments, not only for airlines and passengers but also for local residents, food lovers, shoppers, athletes and tourists. The study also found that organising more diverse projects and events in world airports was related to stronger, more strategic partnerships among airport stakeholders. By integrating the results from each research objective, the proposed airport business models for the 3 selected local and regional airports in Thailand were presented. Three models for innovating the current business model components were suggested to increase airport revenues and ultimately improve technical efficiency. The Airport-as-a-Tourism Platform Business Model, the Local Partner-andEngagement Business Model and the Value Proposition-Oriented Business Model were introduced, as they were the most feasible, practical and appropriate in the context of local and regional airports under DOA operations.  2021 The Author(s).'],\n",

The main purpose of the paper is to discuss the approach of Polish Destination Management Organisations co-creation of tourism experience with the use of ICT on the example of Maopolska Voivodeship, Poland. The approach of Destination Management Organisations to digital tourism marketing should be based on the awareness of both the potential of ICT-based tools and the context they operate in. ICT-related solutions implemented by Destination Management Organisations have to be matched to the ICT infrastructure that exists at the destination or region and the needs of tourists who visit the area. The co-creation of tourism experience is beneficial both for Destination Management Organisations and tourists, but this approach should only be applied when both sides are ready to cooperate.',\n",

              " \"The history of So Tom and Prncipe (STP) shows that the development of the roas, plantations established in colonial times, form a heritage linked to the human development of STP. Various agricultural products have characterized the historical periods of migration, slavery, creolization, and gender emancipation up to the present day; agricultural products and the history of creolization make STP unique, while the relationship between culture and nature provides a useful tool for a better understanding of its historical roots. The essay argues that STP's sustainable development could be fostered by valorizing its historical agricultural heritage. Agri-food geographical indications (GIs), which directly link territories, peoples, and traditions could also serve this purpose. GIs could lead to raising the export price of STP's cocoa, coffee, and pepper, at the same time increasing cultivation of a number of other crops, especially indigenous fruits, which are usually planted in combination. These systems have proven to lead to better prices for products and increase the specialist labour market; they could also foster a multi-faceted approach to territorial development, including eco-tourism. However, challenges remain, as the country is still lacking in proper infrastructures, skilled labour, management, and institutional support. The question will be whether STP's fragile agri-food setting is able to support these new mechanisms, which require strong value chains, respect for territorial biodiversity, and a fresh look at the role played by small farmers running AgriSMEs.\",\n",
              " 'Purpose: The tourist gaze remains a key concept in tourism research. The purpose of this paper is to comprehend the theoretical and empirical development of the tourist gaze notion and its contributions to tourism knowledge, identifying potential research directions by reviewing and analyzing articles that have defined, refined and applied the concept of the tourist gaze. Design/methodology/approach: The study identified 109 relevant research papers primarily through the Web of Science and Scopus databases. Google Scholar, ResearchGate.net and Academia.edu were used to capturing additional work not indexed in the key databases. Qualitative content analysis was used to map the evolution of the concept, distinguish between different perspectives and identify gaps in the tourist gaze literature. Findings: This state of the art paper on tourist gaze outlines Foucaults original work on gaze and power, which underpins subsequent theorization within tourism. The study identifies how the tourist gaze operates in different contexts and circumstances allowing the development of gaze theory. Importantly, the evolution of the gaze theory is presented after analyzing the knowledge gaps, the contexts in which it was used, the methodologies with which it was applied. Based on the findings, the study proposes future works of gaze with the use of technology, science, nature and social media. Originality/value: This paper is among one of the first states of the art papers in tourism literature that comprehensively analyzes the works on the tourist gaze, tracing its evolution and identifying future research directions to address gaps in existing knowledge.',\n",

              " 'This article considers the concerted attempt of the German Democratic Republic and the Soviet Union to influence Scandinavian tourists during Baltic Sea Week in pursuit of their foreign policy goals. The author begins by discussing the implications of public diplomacy within the context of East European socialism. Before examining how German and Soviet public diplomacy strategies intertwined, the paper outlines the methods of socialist public diplomacy and the reactions of the target audience, as well as certain aspects of Eigen-Sinn brought by the western guests. To explore these connections, the paper draws primarily on the records of the Danish working-class movement, the organizing committees and intelligence reports by the East German Ministry for State Security. While foreign tourism in the Soviet Union typically entailed both economic and political interests, the GDR even subsidised foreign tourists and designed package tours to serve almost exclusively political purposes. Focusing on Scandinavian guests, the paper discusses their reaction to the politically loaded tourism experience. Whereas some tourists readily spread the message that the organizers wanted to send, others did not hesitate to criticise what they saw or insisted on their own apolitical agendas. In addition, differing concepts of international understanding reflected the growing distance between Western leftist visitors and Eastern European communist parties. While there were hardly any measurable effects in the political realm, Baltic Sea Week seems to have produced unintended cultural effects resulting from its omnipresent friendship rhetoric and peace message.',\n",

This problem most often affects residents of large cities, due to the intense rhythm of the city and lack of time for personal life, wasted on the way from home to work and back. The empirical basis of the study was the results of a sociological study conducted by the authors in 2019 on the basis of FSBEI HE Russian State Social University (RSSU), FSBEI HE Moscow State Humanitarian and Economic University (MSHEU), and FSBEI HE Russian State University of Tourism and Service (RSUTS). The problem of the deteriorated psychological state of teachers leading to professional burnout is poorly developed and causes increased research and practical interest, and gives rise to the practical need to improve the development of measures for the prevention and avoidance of burnout. All the above makes further research activity highly relevant, and may be extremely necessary in some universities. This is evidenced by the results of the study.: It is of vital importance to take measures to prevent professional burnout of the academic staff and to develop a strategy for a teacher-based approach considering personal qualities and potential. The administration should consider psychological, spiritual, and labor characteristics of teachers for the formation and distribution of individual schedules of teachers. The Novelty of the study is in investigating the professional burnout of the academic staff of an institution in Moscow.',\n",

Tourism, as the most susceptible activity to innovations, responds to digital geography by increasing population flows, developing territories, organizing services and leads to an increase in the level of self-organization of activities. Digital technologies are actively penetrating the field of excursions and independent tourism. Mobile audio guides capture the infinite variety of urban space, help young people get involved in the process of developing audio guides, update knowledge of geography, history, culture and form the skill of digital presentation of the knowledge gained. Digital technologies contribute to the intensive development of independent tourism in places inside of the \"Infrastructures oecumene \". High rates of inbound tourism are registered in Iceland. Tourism in the form of a family trip by car is largely due to the arrival of digital services for accommodation and meals, car rental. In connection with the development of digital geography in the sphere of tourism, new areas of research are taking shape. The main aim of the study is to investigate the role of digital geography in the development of tourism and tourist activities and attempt to draw some practical and innovative conclusion since the tourism industry has been one of the most lucrative industries over the last decades. In this study, methods of analysis and synthesis of scientific literature, data from a review of audio tours of Perm on the izi.TRAVEL platform, and official tourism statistics from Iceland were utilized to fulfil the aim of the study.',\n",

In contrast to other capital-intensive sectors, tourism, as a service-based activity, cannot make significant productivity gains to improve its competitiveness. Moreover, tourism-led economies have an underdeveloped industrial sector that limits opportunities for economic diversification. In this context, this paper presents a three-country dynamic CGE model to analyze the role of tourism quality improvements to achieve sustainable long-term economic growth in mature destinations in a context of international capital movements. According to the results, tourism-led economies may converge in real salaries with wealthier economies when focusing on high-end visitors. On the other hand, cheaper destinations achieve better returns from tourism activity in diversified economies.',\n",

They have been employed within several fields of inquiry due to their propensity to interrogate and challenge existing socio-political power structures and promote political change. Moreover, they are effective approaches to convey meanings to academic and non-academic audiences. Despite this, they have been relatively neglected in tourism. By mobilizing seminal work in the social sciences, performance studies and theatre studies on performance texts and arts-based research, this paper presents and discusses ethnodrama and ethnotheatre as two alternative methodological approaches in tourism. This work contributes to tourism knowledge by partially addressing the need for methodological diversity advocated by qualitative tourism scholars.',\n",

The study differs from previous research by investigating unexplored relationships between animosity, political identification, and outcome variables critical to tourism and hospitality management (risk perception, willingness to pay for accommodations, and tourist activity). A concurrent mixed method design (QUAN + qual) was employed to collect data for the study. 20 semi-structured interviews (Study A) and a questionnaire collected from 330 tourists (Study B) comprise the research design.

The results show evidence of a positive asymmetrical relationship between World Heritage Site (NWHS and CWHS) and both kinds of tourism receipts. The impact of NWHS on DTR follows scale effects, while that of NWHS on ITR obeys the law of decreasing marginal utility. The link between CWHS and inbound and domestic tourism receipts follows an inverse U-shaped pattern. The optimal numbers of NWHS and CWHS obtained from those non-linear models vary, while the effect of NWHS and CWHS on DTR can be strengthened by the presence of each other, but only the impact of CWHS on ITR is influenced by NWHS. Furthermore, we describe the implications of the research results.',\n",

In this context, management of a visitor's attention processes is a key issue in the design of memorable tourist experiences and business success. Psychological research highlights two types of attention processes: bottom-up and top-down. This research is the first to identify factors influencing bottom-up attention during on-site experience and to examine the moderating impact of top-down factors of attention. The empirical research used questionnaires obtained from tourists participating in two animal-based experiences at a theme park. The results show that of the bottom-up factors analyzed, only two influenced attention, Rarity and Environment stimulation. Concerning the moderating influence of top-down factors, the research found that Interpersonal interaction and Task performance/Goal achievement affect the way external factors impact on attention, and that the intensity of this relation varies according to the relevance of this moderation.\",\n",
              " \"Nowadays, it is imperative to use forecasting technologies that are most likely to predict the development of economic systems. Foresight technologies based on a combination of strategic analysis and forecasting of key indicators provide a high level of probability of achieving certain results and contribute to shaping conditions for their achievement. Among economic systems, tourism sector is the most vulnerable to the negative impact of the global pandemic. In 2020, its revenues fell by 70%, leading to an unprecedented crisis. Accordingly, questions arise about the Ukrainian tourism sector's ability to use the crisis as a prerequisite for recovery and growth. Based on the results of a two-round survey using the Delphi method among experts (56 at the first stage and 42 at the second) representing various tourism directions for Ukraine's tourism sector up to 2030, six strategic development priorities were formed. Key indicators were identified, such as contribution to GDP (7-8%), place in the global tourism competitiveness rating (60-70th position among 140 countries), and average annual growth rate of international arrivals (5-10%). It has been determined that in case of the end of the world pandemic, the Ukrainian tourism sector can achieve the indicators of pre-crisis functioning in 1-3 years. The proposed architectonics of the foresight platform in the context of digitalization of network communications will ensure the adoption of management decisions to develop Ukraine's tourism sector in the domestic and international markets. It will strengthen its position, image, and strategic sustainability in the markets for tourist services.\",\n",
              " \"Within the context of official multiculturalism and the promotion of tourism to improve the economic prospects of Taiwanese Indigenous people, ritual dances of 'Amis/Pangcah people, known as malikoda, have become sites of conflict concerning ritual propriety and performance. Although as participatory practices, malikoda can never be performed for an audience, they have served to mediate outside power, including but not limited to ancestral spirits and political figures. However, whether and how those outside 'Amis communities can malikoda remains subject to debate. Malikoda animates a model of Indigenous sovereignty, which can flexibly incorporate external forces that impinge on 'Amis communities. Yet, the felicity conditions for malikoda are unstable. To resolve this, 'Amis people have relied upon a combination of heritage and local discourses that define the dance as an act of hospitality. Both types require the alignment of various actors, media and interpretations at multiple scales, often obviating interpretation. Thus, attention to malikoda highlights how Indigenous people engage with indigeneity as a cultural resource under multiculturalism and raises broader questions about the role of animation in sovereign assertion.\",\n",
              " 'Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to address four questions: Firstly, how do tourists perceive safety from crime, specifically from robbery or violence, alongside other safety concerns? Secondly, are those who are concerned about crime also concerned about other threats to their well-being? Thirdly, how are their perceptions of safety affected by their perceptions of the local community? Finally, how are their perceptions affected by their personal and touristic characteristics? approach: Findings: Firstly, tourists did not generally see crime, specifically robbery or violence, as a problem; secondly, there was only a weak relationship between concern about crime and concern about other threats to their well-being; thirdly, in contrast, their perceptions of safety were strongly affected by their perceptions of the local community; and finally, their perceptions were affected by their personal and touristic characteristics, but not necessarily in the ways suggested by earlier research. Research limitations/implications: The research sample was small and the questionnaire short. Only English-speaking visitors were included. Practical implications: The tourism sector needs to appreciate role of local people in engendering feelings of safety. Social implications: The attitude of the local community and their relationship with tourists is fundamental to helping visitors feel safe. Originality/value: This is the first criminological paper to compare fear of crime with the other safety issues confronting tourists and to relate these concerns to relationships with host community.',\n",
              " \"Terrorism is a major disincentive to tourism. It affects both a country or area's tourists as well as local residents and staff. On the one hand, the prospective tourist is likely to avoid traveling to a high-risk country due to safety concerns, and thus lose the opportunity to visit it, while, on the other hand, the tourism of the country would decline. This work solves the above-mentioned problem by (1) showing that reasonably safe visits to high-risk countries can be predicted with high precision, using limited information, including data on attacks and fatalities from recent years, which is widely available, and (2) creating an algorithm that recommends these periods to potential travellers. The findings of this work would be useful for tourists, citizens, businesses and operators, as well as related stakeholders.\",\n",

Motivation for starting these projects varies and this may hold implications in terms of the responsible function and department overseeing planning and implementation. Knock-on effects of such decisions may also include the level and breadth of stakeholder engagement and consultation in the process, the visions created and the eventual benefits realised. This research explored the potential to widen funding sources for a laneways project in Melbourne, Australia, including crowd funding. An ecosystem services framework was used to extensively consider potential benefits from a project before and during the design phase. The findings indicate that such an approach can be very useful in order to: Widen participation; tailor design to optimise benefits; bring funding from special interest groups; and increase visibility and potential for improved feedback benefits such as green tourism and property values.',\n",
              " 'The geological reserve of Piekieko (Tomaszw Lubelski district, Lublin voivodeship, Poland) was established in 1962 to protect the sandstone boulders untypical of this region. There are anthropogenic earthen ramparts in their immediate vicinity. The presence of the ramparts and boulders contributed to the recognition of this place as an archaeological site - an immovable archaeological monument. Owing to local legends and its peculiar folk name (Piekieko means little hell), scientific monographs and heritage tourism have regarded Piekieko as a prehistoric or medieval place of worship. However, despite the distinctive land relief and a prominent place in local tradition, Piekieko has never been subject to in-depth archaeological research. As a result, we could only have speculated on the original function of the ramparts, their chronology, cultural affiliation, and potential relation to the boulders. This paper addresses the need to determine the history of Piekieko and systematize the history of research concerning this place. It presents the results of interdisciplinary research using geological and archaeological methods, complemented by analysis of archival sources: written, cartographic, and iconographic.',\n",

For its sources, it relies on semi-formal interviews, recorded in February and March 2020 in Kyzyl, with 11 Tuvans who accompanied religious pilgrims, or themselves participated in foreign pilgrimage tours. The first pilgrimage Tuvans undertook in post-Soviet period occurred in 1995, and its destination was India, which is now the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the country of residence of its leader. The first students of Buddhism went there in 1997. Pilgrimage tours were subsequently organized in the early 2000s by Tuvan lamas and first pilgrims who had returned from India earlier. This social movement was developing spontaneously, with pilgrims going abroad separately or in groups, as a centralized structure did not exist at the time. There are three types of destinations popular among pilgrims: foreign locations (residence of His Holiness the Dalai Lama XIV in Dharamsala, India, holy places associated with the life of Shakyamuni Buddha; Nepal, Tibet, Mongolia; Western countries where the Dalai Lama lectures on his teachings), Russian locations (Buryatia, Kalmykia and Saint Petersburg, where Buddhist temples and centers are located), and locations in Tuva proper. The experience of lay pilgrimage in the form of religious tourism allows them to develop an interest in Buddhism to a degree which helps start the internal transition from a traditional Buddhist to a devout Buddhist.',\n",

However, there is a lack of empirical evidence available on how the DSA model functions in practice, including the opportunities, challenges and controversies that can arise. Focusing on the worlds first permanent DSA, the Torrance Barrens Dark Sky Preserve in Muskoka, Ontario, Canada, we examine the stakeholder dynamics involved in DSA establishment and management. Using key informant interviews and survey research, our case study analysis illustrates the nuances of regulating light, showing how various socio-political barriers to light pollution abatement were (or were not) overcome through sustained dark sky activism. The findings inform management strategies for reducing light pollution, while also providing practical information for environmental planners and managers of DSA communities.

Design/methodology/approach: A dual analysis was conducted on 800 online reviews for eight hotel brands. The brands, which are currently operating in Bangkok City, are considered to be representative of their categories. The hotels were selected based on their abilities to meet the quantitative and qualitative requirements of the text mining strategy adopted in this study. Findings: The results reveal that, with respect to all of the hotel service attributes (i.e. Service, Cleanliness, Room, Sleep Quality, Location, Value and Overall), the ratings offered by the English-speaking guests were higher than the Chinese-speaking travelers. Based on the qualitative analysis, the ten service attributes which had the most impact on traveler satisfaction were distinguished. These attributes were then classified into three broadly themed categories including intangible service, tangible service and staying experience. The results from the word frequency analysis also helps to clarify which features are drawing attention from travelers from different backgrounds. Originality/value: This study contributes to tourism and hospitality literature by confirming certain differences in the online rating behavior of Chinese- and English-speaking hotel guests.',\n",

Little research has been conducted on these offshoots. In this article I examine one of the earliest of these efforts, Wikivoyage, a free wiki-based travel guidebook. Design/methodology/approach: I examine the content of Wikivoyages articles on the temples of Angkor, Siem Reap (the tourist gateway to the temples), the introductory page for the country of Cambodia as a whole and a sample of regional Cambodian entries. Textual and discourse analysis is the foundation of this work. Findings: The findings suggest that although Wikivoyage is not currently an exemplar of alternative tourism discourses, it certainly has potential. But that potential can only be realized if those interested in contributing to the site alternative perspectives and discourses take up the task in a sensitive manner and in accordance with the developing editing culture. Originality/value: While conceding that Wikivoyage is currently unlikely to monopolize the guidebook market anytime soon, it is still important to study this social phenomenon both for its own intrinsic interest and to assess its potential for a more enlightened and transformative tourism.

              " 'This paper proposes a new T-3D measurement framework for calculating tourism economic space and as a tool able to assist in determining the sustainability of tourism development. The T-3D framework is described as a tourism-specific version of the Density, Distance, Division (3D) framework. Tourism economic concentration, level of integration and the degree of specialization are used to provide a touristic interpretation of density, distance and division. Taking Hainan Province as an example, this paper outlines the T-3D characteristics of tourism economic space. The results show that Hainan Province has large differences in the distribution of the tourism economy. In addition to the spatial division of the tourism economy, the spatial density and distance of the tourism economy are basically consistent in value. Further, the spatial density and division of the tourism economy exhibits a dual-core based on the cities of Sanya and Haikou, and the spatial distance of the tourism economy exhibits core-peripheral characteristics. The tourism economic space shows that the highest agglomeration based on T-3D characteristics occurs in the east followed by the west with the lowest agglomeration in the middle of the province. Using empirical analysis, the validity of the T-3D analysis system of the tourism economic space is verified and this is more conducive to improving the competitiveness of the tourism industry and promoting sustainable tourism development.',\n",

From the very beginning, however, creative tourism has aimed to contribute to sustainable development and increased community wellbeing, as an alternative to mass cultural tourism. With this review article, our main objective is to identify and analyze a body of literature that specifically addresses creative tourism in islands, contributing to fill a gap in the knowledge since no reviews with this focus have yet been undertaken. Our aim is to provide a critical overview of creative tourism experiences at island destinations worldwide, addressing the plurality of empirical contexts and methodological approaches found in academic research. This review highlights the key trends in creative tourism, pointing out two distinct approaches: creative tourism in urban contexts, based on creative events, cultural clusters or Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs), versus community-focused small-scale tourism experiences in rural contexts. This paper also provides an opportunity to assess the evolution of sustainable creative tourism approaches in islands.',\n",
              " 'The reform of Chinas tax-sharing system in 1994 has not only had a profound heterogeneous impact on the control level of fiscal resources by local government but also might exert a negative effect on the sustainable development of tourism. Based on this hypothesis, this paper uses 19932018 data from 31 Chinese provinces to examine the dynamic relationship between Chinas fiscal decentralization, income gap, urbanization, and tourism growth using a panel co-integration model. Our results show that there is a stable co-integration relationship between fiscal decentralization, income gap, and tourism growth. In general, the impact of fiscal decentralization and income gap on tourism development varies across regions. However, in most provinces, urbanization helps the development of tourism. Urbanization and fiscal decentralization also help reduce the income gap. This shows that the inter-regional government competition promotes not only the growth of tourism but also income equality. To achieve the sustainable development of tourism, China should not only take the advantage of local governments incentives for economic growth but also handle the income gap problem considering local conditions.',\n",

Nevertheless, studies on this segment were not concerned, until present, with the differences in gender intention, evaluation and the overall satisfaction regarding creative tourism activities. For that, this paper examines these three components from a gender perspective regarding the creative tourism activities developed by CREATOUR pilots in the northern region of mainland Portugal between 2017 and 2019. The methods used were quantitative in nature. Five hundred and ninety-five questionnaires were applied to the participants in the 45 creative tourism activities developed by the 10 pilot institutions selected to join the CREATOUR project (Creative Tourism Destination Development in Small Cities and Rural Areas). The questionnaire used consisted of 31 closed questions aimed at the profile, the motivations, the perception and the evaluation of activities by the participants. It used descriptive statistics and discriminate analysis. The main results show that men and women had similar demographic characteristics (e.g., age and educational level), but they were significantly different in some variables, such as their intention to participate in creative activities, and their evaluation and overall satisfaction with their personal experiences. It is statistically confirmed that, based on their experiences in creative tourism, men and women fall into different clusters.',\n",

Several studies have shown the relationship between sustainability choices and value orientation. However, there is a lack of studies that explore how autonomous motivation, based on the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs, might predict sustainability attitudes and preference. The present study aims to explore the relationship between attitudes towards sustainable tourism, preference for a sustainable stay, values orientation, and psychological need satisfaction in Italian adults, testing the hypothesis that also basic needs satisfaction and tourist preferences should contribute to increasing a positive attitude toward sustainable tourism. Participants are 142 Italian adults (M = 42,11 years, 80% women). This research used the online survey method collection and snowball strategy recruitment. The results showed that participants have a high level of attitude and preference towards sustainable tourism. Correlation indicated that there is a positive association between positive attitudes towards sustainable tourism, self-transcendence, and basic psychological need satisfaction. Furthermore, regression revealed that psychological basic need satisfaction, preference for a sustainable stay and value orientation explain peoples attitudes towards sustainable tourism. These findings imply more attention may be needed to psychological needs to understand how people might deal with environmental sustainability.',\n",

Accessible tourism has advantages for both people with disabilities and everyone else. It provides an opportunity for everyone to enjoy leisure without barriers. However, there are still factors that limit the proper operation of the sector, which require a review and new strategies for its improvement. The objective of this review is to offer a synthesis of those challenges that must be addressed in order to achieve quality accessible tourism, as well as to present the various emerging trends that can represent an important advance for the future of accessible tourism. To this end, a qualitative study review process has been carried out where the different opinions and perceptions of the various actors involved in the accessible tourism sector are considered. A thematic analysis and synthesis of the information was conducted using the Thematic Synthesis procedure. The methodological quality of the studies included in the synthesis was also assessed. The studies reviewed show a need to recognize disabled travelers as autonomous and independent people who seek to escape from their daily routine, and who require certain specific supports to facilitate their tourist experience. Accessible tourism is valued as a good market opportunity, but its proper development requires greater staff awareness to promote co-creation in tourism, as well as the support of technological systems to create individualized tourist profiles detailing the needs of each person.',\n",

Despite the increased number of people who travel with access requirements, the sector still lacks an understanding of the expectations and experiences of access tourists. Accessible tourism covers an array of impairments from people who are immobile, visually impaired, an invisible impairment, parents with pushchairs, and seniors. The purpose of this study was to understand the expectations and experiences of the access consumer to suggest improvements for accessibility for the New Zealand tourism sector. The social model of disability was adopted to examine the sector and framed the semi-structured interviews with access consumers. Key results identified from the data were the need to achieve dignity in service offerings to gain experiences that facilitate independence and equity of access, access to information before the travel that is clear and accurate to aid planning, and accessible transport and education. In conclusion, the paper calls for the New Zealand tourism industry to align with the Disability Strategy sustainability goals to achieve equity and inclusion and create enjoyable accessible experiences in their tourist offerings.',\n",

To this effect, the purpose of this quantitative research study is to determine the impact of sales promotion techniques used by different suppliers of tourism services, in the form of 240 travel agencies. Our research focused on determining the effect of utilizing certain sales promotion techniques in order to increase sales in tourism services. Furthermore, we analyzed the way in which travel agencies engage in utilizing sales promotion techniques. We found that grouped sales, early booking, and last-minute techniques are essential practices in the perceptions of the respondents, that associating accommodation with eating services is a very important aspect for the consumer, that including recreation services is preferred but not demanded, and that included transportation services represent additional motivation in the purchasing decision. Additionally, we found that offering free services differentiates agencies from the competition and increases customer loyalty.

In Japan, the 2030 Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) target is an emissions reduction of 26% compared to 2013. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared that the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak has led to 43,341,451 confirmed cases and 1,157,509 confirmed deaths globally and affected 218 countries (as of 27 October 2020). In Japan, as of the same date, 96,948 infectious cases and 1724 deaths related to the new coronavirus had been recorded. These numbers continue to increase. In Japan, in March 2020, the number of international tourist arrivals decreased by about 93% compared to last year at the same period. The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) reported several significant scenarios for the tourism industry. COVID-19 is the greatest shock to international tourism since 1950 and represents an abrupt end to the 10-year period of sustained growth that followed the 2009 financial crisis. It was thought that it would be possible to analyze the economic, environmental, and social impacts of rapid social changes. Thus, this study estimates changes in Japans tourist consumption, the carbon footprint (CFP), and employment due to the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic. The calculations in this study adopt a lifecycle approach using inputoutput tables. Based on these observations, this study uses four scenarios (SR 1, no recovery until December; SR 2, recovery from October; SR 3, recovery from July or September; and SR 0, same growth rate as 20182019) for Japan to calculate the CFP and employment change using inputoutput table analysis based on tourist consumption, which is a tourism metric. According to our results (2019 vs. SR 1 and 3), the consumption loss is between 20,540 billion yen (65.1%) and 12,704 billion yen (39.1%), the CFP reduction is between 89,488 Mt-CO2eq (64.2%) and 54,030 Mt-CO2eq (37.5%), and the employment loss is between 2,677,000 people (64.2%) and 1,678,000 people (37.5%). As of November 2020, the tourism industry continues to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In the post-COVID-19 society, it will be necessary to maintain the GHG emissions reductions achieved in this short period and realize economic recovery. This recovery must also be sustainable for tourism stakeholders and society.',\n",

This is further intensified by tourists seeking authentic experiences in hostguest relations, physical health and well-being, and the consumption of local products and services. Communities, especially those in developing countries, do not yet fully recognize the potential of local sports as a resource and competitive advantage in their destination development. In the same way, tourism research is lacking analyses regarding the role of the community and its specific sports identity. Given this, the present paper aims to systematically review the promising interface between community development and sports tourism. The research questions are based on the potential of identity-based sports and necessary local engagement. These efforts are pursued through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with 49 articles. The results reveal the thematic clusters, research features, and prevalent challenges and benefits that the community has to deal with.

A new integrated model of the coevolution of supply (27 ski areas) and demandside (skier behaviour) climate change adaptation in the ski tourism market of Ontario, Canada is presented. Ski area operations are modeled under a highemission 2050s scenario, with skier responses to altered operations informed by a survey of 2429 skiers. These market adaptive dynamics reveal new insights into differential climate risk, capturing patterns not apparent when considering only operational conditions of ski resorts. A decoupling of ski season length and skier visitation was found at four ski areas, where, despite average season length losses, visitation increased as a result of reduced competition. Simulated skier visit losses were smaller than reductions in season length, contributing to an increase in crowding. Growing the market of skiers was also identified as a critical adaptation strategy that could offset skier visit losses from shortened seasons. Climate change challenges the future sustainability of ski areas in this market in several ways: profitability of ski areas with substantially shorter seasons, increased snowmaking costs, crowding impacts on visitor experience, and potential overtourism at the few most climate resilient destinations.',\n",

Acknowledging and integrating this diversity into decision-making processes can support informed natural resource management. Our empirical study unpicks the multiple ways stakeholder groups perceive the benefits derived from wetland ecosystem services (WES) in the area surrounding the Gialova coastal wetland in Messenia, Greece. The inhabitants from this region benefit from a range of WES, and most livelihoods are closely linked to agriculture and tourism. We aim to understand the patterns in commonly held stakeholder views on WES using Q methodology, a participatory mixed-methods approach. We identified five distinct perspectives on WES from a sample of 32 stakeholders. Alongside diverse perceptions of the relative importance of different WES, we observed a range of explanations of why certain WES are important and analyzed these through the lens of value pluralism. This identified tension between relational and instrumental values. Such analyses move beyond ecosystem service identification towards an understanding of value justifications and conflicts, and can support the deliberation of conflicted views, and policy design in alignment with peoples values.',\n",

However, a key part of the National Energy and Climate Plan is to gradually phase out the use of lignite, which includes the decommissioning of all existing lignite units by 2023, except the Ptolemaida V unit, which will be closed by 2028. This plan makes Greece a frontrunner among countries who intensively use lignite in energy production. In this context, this paper investigates the environmental, economic, and social state of Megalopolis and the related perspectives with regard to the energy transition, through the elaboration of a SWOT analysis, highlighting the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of the municipality of Megalopolis and the regional unit of Arcadia. The analysis is based on four main pillars, namely clean energy, smart agricultural production, sustainable tourism, and other (e.g., industry, technology, and education). The integration of the Energy Efficiency First principle, the mitigation of household energy poverty (especially in a region with district heating installations), and collectively driven energy actions for engaging and empowering younger generations (e.g., in the form of nextgeneration energy communities) are among the solutions that are expected to have a significant contribution towards Megalopolis just energy transition.',\n",

The aim of the paper is to develop a methodological algorithm for short-term forecasting of opportunities to restore the effective activity of enterprises under quarantine restrictions. Seasonal component adjustments were performed in the Demetra+ software. Modeling the recovery of effective activity included an assessment of the influence of macroparameters on the dynamics of an enterprise's sales volumes under pre-quarantine conditions, defining the size of economic losses, determining coefficients of macroindicators' dynamic influence under conditions of differentiation of quarantine restrictions, constructing a matrix of multiple regression equations, which clearly demonstrates the forecast prospects for restoring the effective activity of enterprises, depending on the quarantine zoning. A situational model of the possible scenario dynamics of enterprises' trade turnover was built taking into account the quarantine zoning and the logical transformational algorithms of influence on variable system parameters caused by it. The thermometer principle was used as a fuzzy logic tool to consider the specifics of the dynamics of various linguistic variables and bring the forecast model as close as possible to the epidemiological zoning logic. Approbation of the methodology revealed a clear correlation between the severity of quarantine restrictions and the expected growth of enterprise activity amounts. In a more advanced form, the method should be used for short-term macroeconomic forecasting when determining quarantine restrictions and epidemiological zoning.\",\n",

Every day, at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption, the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall, natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second, we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented towards a citys resilience according to their impact upon the strategic sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their implementation for society. The results highlight that the most essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic master plans for flood protection projects.',\n",
              " \"Cycling tourism is a rapidly developing type of tourism in Europe and it is recognised in the tourism strategic documents of the Republic of Serbia as one of the key tourist products that should be developed specifically in the Danube region. This paper aimed to examine residents' perceptions towards cycling tourism on the Danube cycle route in Serbia using the modified Tourism Impact Attitude Scale (TIAS). In addition, a multiple regression model was used to test the effects of the independent variables on residents' perceptions towards cycling tourism development. The research findings indicate that residents have a favourable attitude towards cycling tourism, which is in the initial phase of development in the study area, and that the independent variables are predictors of residents' perceptions. Implications for tourism development and planning are discussed and future research opportunities provided.\",\n",
              " 'Tourism demand growth during the period between 2000 and 2016 in 25 European countries is calculated using different tourism indicators. It is shown that the number of tourist arrivals and aggregate tourism receipts increase during the period. Tourism receipts per arrival at current prices show a slight increase in the majority of selected countries, while tourism receipts per arrival at constant prices more or less stagnate, ranging from -2% to +2%, and even exhibit sharper decrease in some countries of Southern and Eastern Europe. It can be concluded that tourism growth is predominantly fueled by the increasing number of tourist arrivals and not by receipts per tourist arrival.',\n",

As a result, tourism can contribute considerably to the growth of a countrys economy. Currently, all tourism activities are included in the GDP, but policymakers and entrepreneurs need to identify tourisms contribution to the overall economy. However, the available statistics are not always homogeneous across countries, nor are they collected in a timely manner. The geographic details of available statistics are also insufficient. Estimating the value tourism adds to the economy is methodologically complex because of varying operational definitions and the use of different statistical sources. Conversely, the production of business registers offers a new opportunity to estimate economic aggregates and, in particular, the value added of the tourism sector, even at the local level. Nevertheless, some methodological problems remain.',\n",
              " 'Eco-tourism is a growing part of the tourism industry. However, there are no agreed-upon criteria of what constitutes eco-tourism, so the industry is currently self-identified, with eco-lodges simply declaring themselves so. Here we present the first systematic comparison of eco-tourism versus conventional (or mass) tourism, using as our study area a set of 37 resorts along the southern Red Sea coast of Egypt, all constructed on similarly oriented parcels between the sea and the Red Sea Mountain Range. We compared resorts based on their water, energy, and waste management (all virtually equivalent), and based on mappable environmental parameters such as swimming pool surface area, distance from mangrove patches, conflict with flood plains, extent of lawn area, and means of access to deep water. We found that the self-identified eco-tourism establishments were not significantly different from the conventional tourism resorts in terms of their stress on environmental resources. We recommend that future eco-tourism operations be modified in two key ways. First, on the planning level, by modifying the regional master plan created by the central government tourism authorities. Second, on the site design level, by introducing significant improvements to the design approval processes for the developments to ensure compliance with environmental requirements.',\n",

The research was conducted on all aspects of HR in tourism sector MSMEs, among foreign and domestic tourists in East Java. The research is a quantitative and descriptive one. Primary data are used. The population of the research is HR in tourism sector MSMEs as well as domestic and foreign tourists. The sampling technique used is purposive sampling. Ten cities of high tourism potential were chosen. Determination of the sample size used the minimum criteria of a structural model that is between 100 and 200 units. In total, 200 tourism sector MSMEs were determined from ten tourism cities in East Java. From every tourism sector MSMEs, four employees and three tourists were taken. As a result, the entire research consisted of 800 employees and 600 foreign and domestic tourists. Importance performance analysis (IPA) was utilized as an analysis tool in this paper. The result indicated that each tourism resort, being a sample, has different findings. Batu City demonstrates a lack of transglobal leadership (TL). Malang, Kediri, and Blitar City demonstrate organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). Malang City lacks employment engagement (EE). Meanwhile, Pasuruan City and Blitar Regency are about human resources performance (HRP). For Pasuruan Regency, the variable of quality of work life (QWL) should be improved. For Sidoarjo Regency, sustainable tourism competitiveness (STC) should be paid attention. For Kediri City, the main variable that needs to be enriched is responsible marketing (RM). Overall, for the East Java region, the main variable that needs to be improved is RM. The findings obtained constitute a practical contribution for main tourism stakeholders to formulate relevant policies to cope with problems.',\n",
              " \"Nature-based tourism in protected areas is an easily experienced ecosystem service that humans enjoy, but it acts as tourism pressures on ecosystem. Some park managers, however, lack an understanding of the spatial distribution and ecological impact of these pressures. We analyzed the size and spatial distribution of these pressures in Korean national parks, using visitor statistics and social big data. In addition, by overlay it with endangered species distribution data, we analyzed areas where tourism pressures and ecologically significant areas could be conflicted. The tourism pressure differed according to the individual protected areas characteristics. Due to the unevenness of the magnitude and spatial distribution of pressures, the ecological impacts could be spatially differentiated. This study suggests that tourism pressure may be a decisive factor affecting protected areas' ecosystems with increased visitors. Using social big data, managers can establish spatially explicit management policies that consider tourism pressures on individual protected areas.\",\n",

During the last decades, tourism grew almost steadily, and, since it is a labour intensive sector, even job creation increased, but not equally for men and women, as it happened in every industry. Tourism sector is actually recognized as an important contributor to help creating new job opportunities to women. Indeed, globally, in the tourism industry 46% of the workforce are women, but they suffer from both horizontal and vertical gender segregation of the labour market. In the emerging countries, the situation is even worse. Our paper focuses on bringing out the current condition of women in the tourism sector, particularly in the emerging countries and it presents, with a case study located in India, what happens to women and their communities when the role of women in tourism is supported. In India, indeed, also thanks to organizations such as the Mahila Mandals, women have been supported in their entrance in the job market in the tourism sector and this led to an improvement in their income generation capacity, in their self-esteem and in their bargaining power within the family.',\n",

This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing these patterns based on tourists' digital footprint data collected from online travel diaries. Based on illustrative case study data from Qingdao (China), the framework, combining traditional quantitative and social network analysis, is able to pinpoint: (1) The influence of distance decay and attractions popularity on the spatial patterns of tourist flows; (2) The uneven distribution of the core tourist nodes and the existence of the structural hole phenomenon, which form a network pattern with unbalanced power and intense internal competition; (3) The formation of the core area for tourism along the coastline  as is typical for coastal tourism cities. This difference of tourism resources between coastal and inland areas, thus, remains a challenge for future tourism development in Qingdao.\",\n",
              " 'Background: It is imperative that researchers studying medical tourism connect their work with policy, so that its real-world challenges can be better understood, and more effectively addressed. This article gauges the scope and evolution of policy thinking in medical tourism research through a bibliometric review of published academic literature, to establish the extent to which researchers apply public policy theories and frameworks in their investigation of medical tourism, or consider the policy imperatives of their work. Methods: A Boolean search of the Web of Science (WoS) Core Collection was performed to identify policy-related publications on medical tourism. We analyzed the results using bibliometrics and a data visualization software called VOSviewer to identify patterns in knowledge production and underlying network linkages in policy research on the subject. Results: Our findings suggest that only a small proportion of medical tourism research explicitly addresses policy issues or applies policy paradigms in their study approach. Field-specialized journals serving practitioners publish less research as compared to interdisciplinary social and health policy journals. Moreover, there are significant geographical and disciplinary disparities in the policy-orientation of research, and a predilection towards select policy areas such as reproductive and transplant tourism to the neglect of more holistic governance and health system considerations. Conclusion: This article is a call to action for greater engagement by policy scholars on medical tourism, and for health researchers to more explicitly consider how their research might contribute to the understanding and resolution of contemporary policy challenges of medical tourism. Failure to clearly and consistently make the policy connection is a lost opportunity for researchers to frame the public debate, and influence policy thinking on medical tourism.',\n",

              " \"Despite the growth of offshore wind energy and concerns that projects will harm tourism and recreation, there is a lack of empirical research on the effects of operating wind farms on tourism and recreation. The existing literature tends to treat tourists and recreationists as a monolithic group, focused almost entirely on beachgoers. Further, research regarding offshore wind energy and tourism puts forth a narrow conception of tourists, concerned primarily with a natural seascape. The 30-MW Block Island Wind Farm, the first offshore wind farm in the United States, is located offshore an iconic tourism destination and provides a laboratory for understanding interactions between offshore wind energy and the tourism and recreation sectors. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study through which tourism and recreation professionals and participants met in focus groups to discuss experiences with and observations of this project. Analysis revealed diverse viewpoints and largely positive encounters; though, some negative impacts were identified, and participants weighed project costs and benefits. Perspectives were shaped, in part, by experiences with the planning process. Visual impacts were a major concern; however, most participants described the project's appearance in neutral or positive terms. Overall, the wind farm is functioning as an attractant, either as a novel sight or as a recreational fishing destination. Participants felt the wind farm should be promoted for tourism but cautioned that interest may be short-lived and there may be less support for larger offshore developments. Findings support tourism and recreation sector engagement throughout offshore wind project planning and operation.\",\n",

It aims to decode how these dynamics influence small-scale rural tourism, contesting sustainable rural change and the rural idyll as perceived by the tourists. For this purpose, a standardized survey amongst visitors at the Giant's Causeway, the most visited tourist attraction in Northern Ireland, was conducted. The results show that sustainability awareness decreases from individual trip tourists to coach trip tourists to cruise ship tourists, and thus segment-specific sustainability governance is desirable. By realizing this, a rural tourism hotspot should function as a hub that coordinates and promotes a network of regional tourism providers in order to enable its genuine integration in the rural community.\",\n",

Particularly significant is the role of local non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to facilitate and plan useful projects pertinent to rural development and tourism that aim to include the local population in such activities. During the last two decades, the increasing number of NGOs in developing countries has led to them becoming influential actors in sustainable development in many fields and bearers of various ideas, projects and other activities. This is particularly evident in rural tourism, where NGOs have become prominent in the field of rural attractions as well as in the training and capacity building of local communities. Tens of NGOs whose activities are essentially directed towards rural development are active in Vojvodina, however, their actual role in sustainable tourism is not completely understood. This study regarding the NGOs concerned with rural development aimed to identify, analyse and evaluate the role of non-governmental organisations in sustainable rural tourism in Vojvodina. The starting presumption was that NGOs have a clear and significant role in the sustainable development of rural tourism in Vojvodina. The basic methods and techniques of data collecting were observation and analysis of documents and the techniques of standardised interviews, with elements of indepth interviews.

Based on initial findings, a conceptual model is developed and tested that investigates a tourist's emotional arousal as a mediating variable between the tourism activity type and subsequent storytelling intentions. Based on social facilitation theory and self-expansion model, this research further investigates the potential moderating effect of having a travel companion and that companion's relative ability related to the tourism activity type on the impact of tourism activity type on emotional arousal. Four experiments are used to test the hypothesized relationships. Findings indicate that an experiential purchase has a greater effect on emotional arousal (not pleasure) than the purchase of a physical good. A more challenging(relaxing) tourist activity has a stronger(weaker) positive impact on emotional arousal and a tourist's storytelling intentions. Emotional arousal fully mediates the effect of tourism activity type on storytelling intentions. Having a travel companion, or not, was found to moderate the relationship of tourist activity type and emotional arousal. A challenging tourism activity has a stronger positive effect on a tourist's arousal when traveling with a companion. The arousal effect of engaging in a challenging tourism activity is attenuated when traveling alone. Moreover, based on the moderating effect of having a companion, or not, the perceived ability of a travel companion regarding the type of activity engaged in, was also found to moderate the link between activity type and emotional arousal. The greater the traveling companion's relative perceived ability, the greater the effect on emotional arousal for challenging tourism activities. This effect is attenuated when the ability of the traveling companion is perceived as less than that of the tourist. The paper closes with a discussion of theoretical contributions and managerial implications derived from the findings.\",\n",

Building upon the concepts of optimization and eco-efficiency, we put forward a novel carbon mitigation approach, which seeks to pro-actively determine, foster, and develop a long-term tourist market portfolio. This can be achieved through intervening and reconfiguring the demand mix with the fundamental aim of promoting low carbon travel markets. The concept and the analytical framework that quantitatively inform optimization of the desired market mix are presented. Combining the de-growth and optimization strategies, it is demonstrated that in the case study of Taiwan, great potential exists to reduce emissions and sustain economic yields. The implications for tourism destination managers and wider industry stakeholders are discussed.',\n",
              " 'Turkey, an emerging economy, ranked 8th among the most visited countries in the world in 2017. Given the importance of the tourism sector in Turkey, it is of utmost importance to identify the dynamics of tourism demand to achieve sustainable tourism. The aim of this article is, therefore, to explore the demand-side factors that affect the number of international tourist arrivals to Turkey. To this end, an augmented gravity model has been employed to analyze the factors affecting the number of international tourists visiting Turkey from the top 25 originating countries from 1998 to 2017. The results show that the gravity model is very effective in explaining the tourist arrivals to Turkey. Empirical findings suggest that per capita income of both origin country and Turkey, relative exchange rate, and globalization positively affect the demand for tourism, while it is negatively affected by consumer price index, violence/terrorism, household debt level, and bilateral distance between Turkey and the origin country.',\n",
              " 'The interaction between speleology and tourism has been active in science and society for a very long time. In many countries, tourist caves shape the economic situation at the local and regional level. This shows their value for the development of local communities and for scientific research and promotion of science. Caves represent the indicators of cave tourism development, and they are one of the main geosites for geotourism travel. Transforming speleological objects into show caves has brought numerous positive results for many regions in the world, including Serbia. In this paper, we try to reveal the ability of speleological objects becoming show caves. The case study of our research is four caves in the Valjevo karst area (West Serbia). We examined their current state and the possibilities for cave tourism development. Using the M-GAM (modified geosite assessment model), we evaluated these four caves and thus determined their values and show cave potential. The obtained results point out the significant values of the explored speleological geoheritage, which possess imposing cave tourism potential. Moreover, the regional conception and creation of a geopark in this area is an evident potential, and more concrete indicators are presented in this paper. Cave tourism in the Zlatibor region is considered an important aspect of a potential geopark in Western Serbia and Valjevo karst area as a crucial complementary potential. The importance of including these caves in the tourist market has been determined by the research results. Active cave tourism of researched geosites can significantly influence both local and regional economic growth, as well as the concept of sustainability of the cave environment and its ecosystem, education, and responsibility.',\n",
              " 'A picture is worth a thousand words. Analysis of the visual content of tourist photos is an effective way to explore the image of tourist destinations. With the development of computer deep learning and big data mining technology, identifying the content of massive numbers of tourist photos by convolutional neural network (CNN) approaches breaks through the limitations of manual approaches of identifying photos visual information, e.g., small sample size, complex identification process, and results deviation. In this study, 531,629 travel photos of Jiangxi were identified as 365 scenes through deep learning technology. Through the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, five major tourism topics are found and visualized by map. Then, we explored the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of different tourism scenes based on hot spot analysis technology and the seasonal evaluation index. Our research shows that the visual content mining on travel photos makes it possible to understand the tourism destination image and to reveal the temporal and spatial heterogeneity of the image, thereby providing an important reference for tourism marketing.',\n",
              " \"Tourism industry is observed as one of the hardest hits by Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. It caused severe drop in travel demands and putting many SMEs at risk which lead to job losses at global level. Much business expertise predicted that it would take longer time for the industry to recover especially on the international tourism market. This is due to changes in people's behaviour relating to social distancing, personal hygiene and safety, and likelihood to be more vigilant to travel overseas in the future. While Malaysia and Indonesia are recognized as prominent health tourism destinations in South East Asia, these countries are deeply distressed by this transformation too. Therefore, this paper discusses the positive images of these destinations to help tourism players to improve their marketing strategies during this critical time. The findings of this study are significant to recognize the impacts of Covid-19 outbreak and to strengthen crisis management strategies in the future. Finally, it will allow destination to boost its product profile in the target market and become more resilient to any future shocks.\",\n",
              " 'The pursuit of subjective wellbeing (SWB) via tourism has been well recognised. Little has been done to unpack how tourists engage in a different pace of life, generally from speedup at home to slowdown in destinations, to pursue wellbeing. Drawing upon a theoretical framework based on the established literature on SWB and the temporality of tourism, this paper examines the pursuit of wellbeing by tourists who engage in what we call temporal retreat. The case study is Lijiang Old Town, a well known destination in Yunnan province, China. Specifically, this paper examines how a group of domestic independent tourists experience slowdown and relaxation in Lijiang as a favourable contrast to the bustling rhythm at home. We ask the following research questions: In what ways can temporal retreat help tourists to enhance wellbeing? To what extent does the pursuit of wellbeing via tourism further a temporal understanding of the therapeutic qualities of tourist destinations? We argue that the experiences of slowdown by tourists in destinations can bolster therapeutic forms of social and spatial orchestrationan explicit marking of time in contrast to speedupfor the purpose of enjoying comfort and enhancing wellbeing. As such, an analysis of tourism through a temporal perspective offers a rich milieu for both interrogating the need for alternative temporalities to improve the quality of life and extending the literature on subjective wellbeing into the terrain of tourism consumption.

I also examine howbeside the predictable alliances of conservative and church groups with the stateprogressive feminists and leftist activists aligned themselves with the state in their opposition to sex tourism and reinforced, perhaps inadvertently, practices of spectacular security and city-staging. These practices materialized in ways that provided further legitimacy to the invisibilization of sex workers from tourist sites, who were seen as at odds with the image of a world-class, safe, family-friendly city. While the nation mourned the spectacular defeat of the Brazilian soccer team, sex workers, too, lost dramatically during the World Cup, through new forms of sexual governance that targeted sex tourism.',\n",
              " 'Promotion of tourism for decades has triggered a phenomenon of tourist overcrowding, with harmful effects for the resident population of the tourist territories (mainly the difficulty of access to housing), and especially for natural resources and the environment. The (imperative) need for tourism policies to be sustainable is forcing the gestation of measures so far unthinkable, which go through the limitation of the number of visitors in their different manifestations. This article sets out as a fundamental objective the analysis of the causes of tourist overcrowding, which go through a strictly numerical promotion of the number of visitors or the incentive of tourist holiday housing; Likewise, the impact of the massification on the price of housing, the expulsion of the resident population, or the generation of social conflicts and phobic tourism is studied. The methodology followed for this article consists of an analysis of the sociological and anthropological changes experienced mainly in Spain (and the rest of Europe) and Brazil, and the revision of the existing regulations, in order to confirm whether it is still useful for the purpose pursued., or if on the contrary it should be subject to review. As the reader will check next, the latter is the result achieved, always from the perspective of reconciling tourism as an economic activity, and the preservation of the environment. In conclusion, the implementation of environmentally sustainable tourism policies is suggested from the aspect of land management, taxation, the limitation of tourist rental and access to public domain spaces, among others.',\n",

The Zivot and Andrews unit root test accommodating single unknown structural break in the series is applied to test the unit root properties of the variables. The cointegration between the variables is examined by using the BayerHanck combined approach, and bounds testing approach to cointegration is applied to test the robustness of cointegration results. We find that the variables are cointegrated for a long-run relationship. Tourism (tourist arrivals, tourist receipts) improves income distribution by lowering income inequality. Economic growth is positively linked with income inequality. Trade openness declines income inequality. The causality results indicate the unidirectional causality running from tourism to income distribution.',\n",

However, when a literature review was conducted, we found differences in the estimated elasticities, accordingly to the measure that was used. This article investigates these two measures, exploring the theoretical link between them in the context of tourism demand modelling at a destination level. Having established the theoretical connection between the two variables with implications on the estimated elasticities, we estimate tourism demand models using international arrivals and tourist expenditures for 191 countries from 1998 to 2016, providing evidence for the theoretical connection. Our results show that when both tourist demand measures are used, the estimated elasticities may differ.',\n",

This study, therefore, contributes to the body of knowledge on CMT by focusing on the Eastern Cape and undertaking a provincial level analysis. Coastal and Marine Tourism location visitor profiles in terms of socio-economic profile, types of CMT visitors, types of CMT activities participated and future interest in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. CMT encompasses activities and resources in and near coastal and marine areas that attract visitors who participate in a range of active and passive business, adventure, leisure and recreational activities that generate socio-economic and environmental benefits. A quantitative approach is adopted, drawing on 700 visitor surveys that were conducted at purposively selected CMT locations in the Eastern Cape. Visitors were from a range of socio-economic backgrounds. There were high levels of participation in CMT activities, especially coastal leisure and recreational activities. Results indicate increased CMT location visitation demand. From a sustainability and responsible tourism perspective, understanding who visits CMT sites assists in ensuring effective planning to manage demand and protect/ conserve coastal and marine resources.',\n",
              " 'The global economic outlook is more uncertain than ever before and sensitive to uncertainties related to a variety of economic policies decisions of all stakeholders and governments. These perceived uncertainties may be the culprit in shrinking the size of overall economic activity. Under increasing uncertainties, travel and vacation plans of consumers can be canceled or postponed. Therefore, policy-related economic uncertainties are expected to affect tourism demand beyond well-established economic and noneconomic factors. In this study, we explore the efficacy and the impact of the economic policy uncertainty (EPU) index in predicting the tourism demand on international tourist arrivals (a measure of tourism demand) to the United States from Mexico and Canada over the period of January 1996September 2017. The findings of the study reveal that EPU is a significant predictor as increases in the EPU index lead to decreases in tourism demand to the United States. Canadian tourists seem to be more sensitive to EPUs. Increases in the EPU index cause them to reduce Canadians vacations to the United States proportionally more than the Mexicans. To enhance the explanatory power of current models, the uncertainty can be a theoretically significant construct thus needs to be included when calibrating demand models.',\n",
              " \"Small island developing states (SIDS) face unique developmental challenges, not least their often narrow economic structure and dependence on a narrow range of economic activities. In this regard migration, remittances, dependence on aid, tourism and state employment feature prominently. This paper explores the nature of Niue's economy and the degree to which its economy depends on tourism and government services, both of which are supported through aid programmes. The limited dependence on remittances places Niue, as a SIDS, into the relatively narrow band of TOURAB states (those dependent on aid, tourism and bureaucracy). Understanding the nature of Niue's economy helps clarify the challenges the country faces, its development needs and the considerations which donors need to focus on through their support. It also clarifies how Niue should position itself relative to market opportunities and what the focus of development strategies should be.\",\n",

This research attempts to address this issue by proposing a model of customized day itineraries with consideration of transport mode choice. With improved particle swarm optimization and differential evolution algorithm, a nondominated sorting heuristic approach was devised. A case study was carried out in Chengdu, China to examine the performance of our approach. The results show that compared with extant methods, our approach achieves better performance. In addition, our approach can create more sensible, multifarious, and customized itineraries than previous methods. Tourism organizations and mobile map app providers could integrate our proposed model into their existing smart service systems, as part of their e-business or digital strategy for enhancing tourist experience.',\n",

The variables representing economic and tourism growth are growth rates of per capita GDP and international tourist arrivals per inhabitant respectively. Using the concept of economic regime, the paper introduces a notion of distance between the dynamical paths of different countries. Then, a Minimal Spanning Tree and a Hierarchical Tree are constructed to detect groups of countries sharing similar performance. The two main clusters we find can be interpreted as two groups of countries with high and low performance in the tourism sector and are coherent with the business cycle. The evolution of such clusters shows three main stylized facts: certain countries move across clusters; the low performance cluster tends to span, while the high performance one tends to be (more) compact; the distance between the two groups increases in time.',\n",

It does so by exploring the meanings assigned by domestic Chinese tourists, based on their socially and culturally held beliefs, while they interact with architectural imitations imported from alien cultures. The primary research method is an emergent qualitative design that involved in-depth interviews of Chinese tourists at the eight copysites considered in this study. The findings reveal three relevant themes. Reconceptualization of authenticity indicates that the concept of imitation has very different connotations in China compared to those in the West. Cultural self-exploration reflects an evolving stage of intercultural maturity manifested by Chinese tourists. De-globalization has led to cultural homogenization of the tourist spaces in China. The findings fill the lacuna in existing theoretical streams of tourism authenticity by clarifying the position of copysites and has practical implications for domestic tourism marketing organizations in China.',\n",
              " 'To reduce the negative effects of tourism on the environment, the importance of ecotourism is increasingly considered because this form of tourism helps to protect the environment and sustainable development of an area. So, it is important to determine suitable places for tourism to better manage the study area. The aim of this study is to identify potential ecotourism sites using ordered weight averaging (OWA) and fuzzy quantifier algorithms in the north of Fars province, Iran. Required spatial data such as geology, soil, slope land, topographic roughness index (TRI), vegetation, surface water, elevation, protected area, climate, distance to road, and distance to the village were utilized. To prepare ecotourism maps with different confidence levels, eleven ordered weights were applied corresponding to the eleven parameters that were rank-ordered for each parameter after the modified factor weights were applied. Also, the feature selection algorithm (random search and genetic search methods) was used to select the most important parameters to determine the ecotourism map. The results showed that, with decreasing risk ( = 0), almost all of the study area was unsuitable for ecotourism while, with increasing risk ( = 20), all of the study areas were suitable for ecotourism. One of the ecotourism maps prepared with different confidence levels can be suggested based on the different conditions of tourists so that, if the tourist has a limited time, ecotourism maps with a higher degree of confidence levels are recommended and vice versa. This is one of the innovations of the present research. Also, the results of the random search method with the least error show that slope, elevation, climate, distance to river, and distance to road parameters are the most important parameters in preparing the ecotourism map of the region. So, using the results of the research, many economic problems, such as unemployment, will be solved by managers by preparing tourism maps and creating service jobs for tourists. With the OWA method, tourism zoning maps can be controlled by managers in order to provide better services and social and economic justice.',\n",

The fundamental data used in this study were collected from a series of media reports, press releases and statistical sources in Algeria. Additionally, an important collection of secondary data from different sources was also used. The findings reveal that the Sahel security issues in Africa have had serious implications for the tourism industry in Algeria. The political instability of the neighbouring countries has made security the centrepiece of Algerian foreign policy. The study also shows that the Algerian security policy is based on a set of principles that are not changing over time, thus, it has not been flexible enough to respond to actual changes in the security situation. As a result, tourism has been locked in the country's foreign policy, which unintentionally forces Algeria to abandon what could be one of the most powerful engines of economic growth.\",\n",

Many are employed as guards and security personnel. Others roam the beaches, selling souvenirs and touting tourist services, while some are involved in sex-tourism. In this article, we show how these men skillfully employ their traditional materiality: red robes, swords, daggers, clubs, beaded sandals and jewelry, as well as their own muscular bodies, so as to construct an extraordinary image, which they use to attract the attention of tourists and promote their businesses. Concomitantly, their use of modern material objects, such as mobile phones and stylish sunglasses, undermines their extraordinary image, making their presence mundane and even disturbing, to the extent of being accused by some Tanzanians and tourists of faking Maasai identity. We conclude by arguing that material objects and the ways in which they are used may define people as ordinary and extraordinary at the same time. Materiality therefore underlies a complex, dynamic, and ambiguous perception of the extraordinary in contemporary tourism.',\n",

The findings revealed that social media moderates the relationship between CBBE and the intention to select a destination. This study offers strategic implications for the struggling tourism industry of Pakistan by providing an understanding of international tourists intentions regarding Pakistan as their final choice. Social media has an undeniable power which can not only change tourists minds but also rebuild or reconstruct the image of the country. The findings can help the travel guides, social media tourist advisors, and especially the tourism industry of Pakistan, to use social media to rebuild the soft image of Pakistan in the mind of tourists. This will not only be helpful in attracting more tourists but will boost the hospitality business in Pakistan and business organizations can obtain the first mover advantage as well. Nevertheless, social media has a wide spectrum for consumers, especially for tourists. The tourism and hospitality industry have been widely influenced by social media but they remain little understood in the context of Pakistan as there some security issues which have damaged this industry completely in Pakistan.

The results show that: 1) Land use functions of the village are affected by land use transition and was transformed from the traditional single function of agricultural production, social security, and ecological conservation into a compound leisure sightseeing and economic development function, increasing the economic benefit while ensuring the ecological benefits, and showing the characteristics of diversity and integration. 2) There are significant differences in the pattern of change in the different stages of development in the research area, including the stage of single agricultural production function, the stage of multiple function transformation transition, and the stage of multi- functional compound transformation. The change of land use functions includes three modes: mainly agriculture but supplemented by rural tourism, combining agriculture and tourism; gradually shrinking agriculture, and mainly rural tourism; and overall transformation. 3) Natural conditions are the basis of the land use functional change; changing operators is the inner impetus for the transformation of land use functions; regional development policy is the fundamental driving force; and the demand of expanding the scale of the tourism market is also an important driving factor of rural and land use functional change. These factors interact with each other, and together drive the change of land use functions.',\n",

The case studies include the famous Transylvania, Romania as well as the two comparative destinations in Southeast Asia namely Bali in Indonesia, and Penang in Malaysia. Although tourism planners have limited control over the content of the films produced in the respective destinations and how the destinations are being portrayed in films, it is reflected in our studies that, the imaginary, visual representations of the destinations, albeit negative or distorted from their original identities, are still useful and viable to promote the tourist destinations. The three discussion cases form up the stratification of multiple stages in terms of implementing film-induced tourism strategies to promote their destinations, spanning from one of the oldest film-induced tourist destinations Transylvania, to an over decade-long film-induced destination Ubud in Bali, to a sprouting film-induced destination George Town in Penang. Such a stratification of three comparable destinations leads to both the vertical and horizontal evaluation of the effectiveness of film-induced tourism strategies. Hence, a methodology of multiple-case study with mixed-methods characterised by a set of differing qualitative research approaches will be adopted to the three distinctive destinations, respectively. Emerging markets require new techniques and strategies of marketing, especially in the unsettled post-COVID-19 era. Findings may be useful to destination managers in planning an effective destination image strategy in order to achieve the most sustainable positive impacts and aligning the films image of the destination with the desired image and the potential audience reach.',\n",

The purpose of this study is to investigate how to balance the preservation and presentation during the tourism development in digital times. In recent developments related to cultural tourism, the villages and towns with lesser stocks of red cultural heritages are suffering from a lack of preservation and in danger of vanishing. Apart from the form of traditional museums responsible for cultural heritage preservation, the protected model of Ganjiang River watershed in digital is one of the few alternative paths. With the promotion of an entire digital city network during the watershed area, the gap between urban and rural areas has been widened in the preservation for red cultural heritage. For rural areas, the model of an open air museum is a good choice in digital times. Based on the basin's protection practice and tourist diversity demand, upgrading interpretation systems and improving digital experiences have become the trend for red cultural heritage presentations. Effective online communication is another way to display red culture. Two models of protection and presentation for red cultural heritage have been developed.\",\n",

The survey was conducted on a sample of 307 rural tourists in Croatia. A Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (pls-sem) was applied in order to analyse the relationship between the measured constructs. The modified ruralqual model has been proven as a reliable and valid multidimensional scale that includes 27 items divided into 5 dimensions. Results indicate that there is a significant positive relationship between Service quality and Satisfaction as antecedents to Loyalty. The role of Trust as a mediator between Satisfaction and Loyalty has been proven, but its mediation power is rather small. Research results indicate that rural tourism managers and owners paid more attention to the tangible service quality elements, but in order to improve overall tourist experience in the future, they should pay more attention to the intangible service quality elements. The modified ruralqual instrument should be periodically used as a tool by practitioners and managers for the future development of rural tourism.',\n",

Hong Kong college students (N = 203) were assigned to three experimental groups in which they were exposed to a hotel advertorial on an online blog, a VR 360 video on a mobile phone, or a VR 360 video using Google Cardboard goggles. The results supported the hypothesis that presence plays a mediating role in the relationship between the use of VR in tourism advertising and consumer response. As one of the first studies in the tourism field to investigate the effects of a virtual depiction of a real-world environment on consumption intentions, the findings reveal how VR technology can be used to promote a hotel by generating a sense of presence. This study makes a further contribution to the VR literature by finding that the use of Cardboard goggles did not produce a significantly greater sense of presence in the experience of advertorial viewers. The theoretical contributions and practical implications of the findings for the use of VR technology in branding and promotion are discussed.',\n",

Inspired by Foucauldian discourse theory and Actor-Network Theory [ANT], we use the concept of relational agency to analyse how the Batwa contribute to conservation and tourism development, and deepen our understanding of agency in the context of the Batwa at the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park (Uganda). Based on this conceptualisation we analysed the dominant (academic and non-academic) discourses on the Batwa in the light of in-depth ethnographic research to seek for alternative Batwa realities. Whereas scientific, NGO and governmental literature predominantly reduced the Batwa to marginalised, poor and oppressed victims of development, our ethnographic research observed the Batwa as a vibrant community that deploys expertise on forest ecology, tourism entrepreneurship, organisational capacity and political activism. With such insights we discuss the consequences of agency reduction and the ways to take the Batwa's situational agency into account. Highlighting the multiple realities of Batwa-ness provide a starting point of relating with the Batwa in ways that acknowledge them as agential, rather than only marginalised.\",\n",

Research of travel behavior concerning the characteristics of tourists has provided effective information for transportation planning. Due to different city plans, public transportation system design, car parking design and management, etc., the local situation in developed countries differs from the counterpart in China. However, little research has studied the factors influencing the choice of travel destinations in tourism. The research aims to study the tourism destination and mode choice behavior of tourists and provides suggestions to improve tourism transportation service system. An online questionnaire survey is used to collect data including the travel characteristics and personal attributes of local tourists in different holidays in Hangzhou, China. A multinomial logit model is constructed with the trip destination set as the dependent variable. Results show that age, residential type, car ownership, companion type and holiday length have a significant impact on destination choice. To determine what influences modal choice for such trips, a second logit model is established with travel mode set as the dependent variable with the explanatory variables of age, gender, companion type, car ownership, holiday length and travel destination found to be significant. The results demonstrated that people aged 26 to 44 prefer suburban areas, and they are the main group driving to their travel destination. Public transport use frequency decreases when the destination is located outside of the main tourist area. Finally, suggestions have been proposed to mitigate the congestion and parking problem based on model analysis from the perspective of the bus line setting, transfer improvements, and the policy to limit cars, respectively.',\n",
              " \"This paper outlines potential opportunities for Africa's Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) development driven by blue economy from key strategic sectors including: Coastal and Marine Tourism; Climate Resilience; Environment; Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure. The sectoral approach is key to economic development in Africa with potential for income generation, employment creation and poverty reduction, as well as creating blue and green carbon sinks to address climate change problem and environmental management in African LMEs. The sectors establish linkages to countries' established Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change making it possible to promote Integrated Approach at national, regional and continental sustainable development in Africa. The approach is complemented by the utilizing desk-top literature review and secondary data source on LMEs in Africa for blue economy. This approach is supplemented with professional experts' views and opinions, and additional data gathered from field visits to 13 African countries in August 2019 and Nairobi, Kenya Africa Blue Economy Strategy Consultative Workshop in October 2019. The Blue Economy approach development in Africa will benefit both inland and coastal countries. It is recommended that a strong development of the continental tourism will boost the demand for tourism services and infrastructures. The development of eco-tourism will contribute to the conservation of ecosystems and reduce the ecological footprint. Blue Carbon and Ecosystem Services offer an opportunity to develop coastal wetland projects to mitigating climate change. Coastal protection, biomass production and water purification are among the most important ecosystem services delivered by African LMEs. Their current value is estimated to the average monetary value of carbon sequestration of about USD 130,000 per km2 of mangrove, salt marshes and sea grasses.\",\n",
              " 'Because of its high naturalness and biodiversity, Natura 2000 network (N2K) is becoming increasingly important for recreational opportunity, providing benefits in terms of physical and mental health through outdoor experiences. Nature-based tourism (NBT) is tourism based on the natural attractions of an area: the greater the recreation opportunities, the greater the attractiveness to people. N2K sites are suitable places to favour the development of the NBT, as N2K is not a system of strict nature reserves from which all human activities would be excluded. The approach to conservation and sustainable use of N2K areas is much wider, largely centred on people working with nature rather than against it. To do this, a balance between nature-based tourism development and ecological protection should be reached. In this work, we propose the application of spatial multicriteria analysis, in order to analyse multiple conflicting dimensions interacting over time, considering in particular both criteria related to NBT development and ecological protection. The aim of the work was to analyse the opportunities of Nature-based tourism development in N2K in Umbria, one of the Regions of central Italy, which consists of 102 sites. In particular, the work considered the conditions of biodiversity conservation, flora and fauna, as well as the leisure opportunities provided by the sites and the pressure produced by human activities on them. A spatial multicriteria analysis has been carried out to understand the potentiality of the N2K at territorial level. In particular, the proposed methodology would like to support decision makers in the identification of N2K sites in which NBT activities could be improved and developed, in a balanced way according to biodiversity conservation. Results show, according to preferences set by three different kinds of experts, that only a small bunch of N2K sites could be suitable for an increase of the NBT.',\n",

We propose a hedonic regression model to quantitatively determine the effect of criminal violence on housing prices in the 20152016 period in Acapulco City. In addition to structural variables of the housing, our model includes hedonic variables such as the number of murders that occurred in the neighborhood of the housing, school closures due to shooting episodes nearby, and a compound index of tourism.

              " 'This study is one of the first attempts to identify and explain the location of food festivals in the context of locally embedded capitals. A multidimensional spatial model was developed and a typology using the kmeans method was carried out to evaluate the mapping of 64 food festivals organized in various locations in Poland. With reference to Bourdieus concept, the economic, social, cultural, symbolic, and tourism capitals rooted in the local environment were examined and compared with the location of festivals. From the theoretical point of view, this study extends the theory of capital to include the new category of tourism capital, which allows better understanding of the economic effects of festivals. It is the missing element of the circular mechanism of capital conversion. Our study shows that food festivals in Poland are held mainly in large cities and their neighboring municipalities rather than in peripheral rural areas. We indicate that the urban areas have a higher level of capitals and sustainability of capitals for food festivals than rural areas. The conducted research shows that the economic effect of food festivals is stronger in locations with high tourism capital. The proposed model is universal and can be used to analyze the impact of various festivals on capital conversion and local development.',\n",

Therefore, due to the new demands of the tourism economy, the major shift in the usage of historic city centers occurredthe process of touristification, that results in the emergence of its new, unsustainable form. Despite the significance of those circumstances, there is a lack of any broader quantitative research that would present the dynamic of the Airbnb phenomenon.

              " 'Against the backdrop of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3, good health and wellbeing, this paper reports on a study that examined how outdoor guides perceive their role in facilitating the psychological wellbeing of tourists who consume slow adventure experiences. These experiences, such as canoeing, stargazing or foraging, are characterised by a slower passage of time, immersion in the natural world and a sense of belonging to small social groups. Grounded in research on wellbeing from a positive psychology perspective, the study utilised semi-structured, in-depth, interviews with ten outdoor adventure guides in the Scottish Highlands and Islands. Following a hermeneutic interpretive approach to analyse the interview transcripts, the findings revealed how perceptions of time, meaningful moments and a sense of togetherness are choreographed by slow adventure guides to shape tourists psychological wellbeing through immersive guided experiences, ultimately helping tourists to re-establish a much-yearned-for connection with nature. The study adds to tourism, wellbeing and sustainability literature by providing new perspectives on psychological wellbeing through guided slow adventures. In particular the findings contribute to positive tourism, or tourism and positive psychology field of research, by revealing how mindful and eudaimonic visitor experiences are organised by adventure tour guides in natural settings.',\n",

Cruising in the Asian regions has considered as a potential growth in the transport and tourism industry. In this paper, we aim to provide suggestions to industrial practitioners on the development of the cruise port in Asia and identify the key elements of a regional leading cruise hub as desired by different users. Nevertheless, the majority of cruising-related studies were focused on tourism management in the North American and European regions. Relevant cruising studies on maritime transport management in the Asian region are under-researched. In doing so, we newly propose the CRUISE PORT framework by illustrating four representative countries in Asia (South Korea, Japan, Vietnam and Singapore) to look for common characteristics and unique features of cruise ship market in the Asian region. In order to give the valuable information and provide insight into the framework, we carried out semi-structured, in-depth interviews with different practitioners involved in the cruise industry. Through the framework, it fosters the industrial practitioners to implement cruise port strategies, cruise lines strategies and local government planning for the cruise destinations.',\n",
              " 'Tourism experiences, also called vacations, are known to boost subjective well-being, although it has been argued that the effects are primarily affective in nature and short-lived. We argue that this is a methodological artifact due to the brief duration1year or lessof almost all extant longitudinal studies of tourism experience effects. Based on broaden-and-build and personal resource theories, we hypothesize that tourism experiences contribute to both affective and cognitive components of subjective well-being over a multi-year timespan. Using random intercept cross-lagged panel models, we tested these hypotheses in 8years of panel data based on a representative sample of the population of the Netherlands. We found both between- and within-individual effects of vacation frequency on cognitive as well as affective well-being. More frequent vacationers experienced higher life satisfaction and lower negative affect, while the average participant also experienced slightly higher life satisfaction and positive affect following a year with higher vacation frequency. Increases in life satisfaction also predicted more frequent vacationing in a following year, consistent with an upward spiral pattern of improving well-being based on accumulation of positive experiences, as suggested by the broaden-and-build theory.',\n",

              " \"The purpose of the study is to examine whether two different work commitment profiles influence service quality in the hospitality sector in Slovenia and Serbia and how the implications of the differences can be used in the tourism and hospitality industry. Combining a qualitative and quantitative approach, two new instruments were developed for this study. The first instrument was created on the basis of short, structured interviews with employees. Two factors explaining the two different commitment profiles were determined with statistical analysis and with the method of clustering, four dimensions of commitment profiles forming were extracted. The second instrument was developed on the basis of existing evaluation forms for employees in the tourism industry and interviews with leading and middle managers of hotels. The findings of the study show that there is a small proportion of professionally-oriented employees in the tourism sector, and the difference among employees is evident in the ranking of working values. These results could be useful for managers in planning and organising their human resources and also in planning further development of their companies' human resource policies. The original contribution of the article is the ranking of working values and the perception of quality work by employees in the hospitality sector.

As a sustainable development strategy in rural areas, agritourism has increasingly attracted more attention from policy-makers, scholars and officials. The aim of this research was finding a localized but generalizable model by means of assessment and evaluation of important tourism gardens in Simin Region located in Hamedan City, which is a region with numerous tourism gardens, especially agritourism ones. The research methodology consisted of grounded theory and interview with four involved groups, namely experts, urban managers, residents and tourists who were familiar with the region. The interviewees were selected by snowball sampling and MAXQDA software was used for analysis of the concepts and facilitating the coding process. The results show that inclination toward small and temporary businesses in the field of agritourism is more prominent in Simin Region. Therefore, considering the existing agricultural capacities of the region, establishment and development of agritourism can help the farmers as a complementary activity in the agricultural sector. Also, if the presented solutions are properly implemented in this region, they can lead to other advantages of agritourism realization such as creation or strengthening of spatial branding, development of infrastructures and services, creation of more capacities for attracting tourists and economic prosperity.',\n",

Through a qualitative analysis of women managers from twenty-four medium and large tourism firms in China, the study provides evidence of Guanxi as socially embedded personal relationships for the exchange of favors, enabling women managers to initiate specific types of women intrapreneurship initiatives in their organizations. The findings reveal how the women managers draw on three forms of guanxi (external, within and back-stage) to display intrapreneurial actions as well as the firm-specific factors that constitute important determinants of women intrapreneurship. The managerial implications for encouraging and supporting women intrapreneurs are critically examined.',\n",

Clustering techniques have sought to identify target markets but are widely criticised for the biases they induce. Persistent Homology identifies key tourist groupings with similar behaviours without the prejudice of the functional forms inherent in most regression models. It further produces more focused, and therefore easily promoted to, markets. Consequently Persistent Homology can highlight obtainable promotion opportunities that otherwise would be missed. This paper provides an example of its application to identify the highest, and lowest, spenders amongst tourists visiting the United Kingdom. We further provide an intuitive theoretical background highlighting the inherent value of the methodology for tourism research. Potential for impact in applications to other aspects of tourism practice is also great as we signpost therein.',\n",

Transport infrastructure and organization, along with economic, social, ecological and political factors, are the basic stimulators for the development of tourism. In literature on the subject, this problem is rarely discussed. This article is of a review and research nature. The aim of it is to consider the condition of innovativeness of railway transport companies in Poland in the context of its role in the development of tourism in Poland. To attain the goals of this research, a critical analysis of literature on the subject and desk research have been carried out, the latter drawing on the unpublished data of Statistics Poland, referring to Polish companies from section Transportation and storage, class Passenger rail transport, interurban (according to NACE rev.2).

In the article, there was used data concerning: innovation activity, types of innovation, co-operation during innovative activity, importance of the source of information for innovation activity, importance of the reasons and barriers to not innovate. The data analysis reveals a rather low level of innovativeness of railway transport companies in Poland. In the authors opinion, this state of affairs is connected with historical and political factors: the structure and failed reforms in this sector and granting development priority to other branches of transport during the structural transformation in Poland.',\n",

This relation also contributes to the concept of the multifunctionality of agricultural land. However, in the management of protected areas in Spain, the role of tourism and the public use of areas of maximum protection are often prioritised to the detriment of the agrarian societies with a permanent presence in these surroundings. In this paper, we analyse the impact of environmental planning and rural development on the characterisation of private tourist services in the Sierra de las Nieves natural park (near Mlaga, Spain), using statistical sources, surveys and interviews with stakeholders. The results obtained show that the geographic distribution of private facilities is largely unrelated to public considerations. We view this outcome as a consequence of the disjunction between the agrarian traditions of local society and the new measures adopted to promote tourist activities.',\n",

Some locations, although considered important for local tourist destinations as part of a standard repertoire, do not comply with modern standards. For tourism organisations, it is very important to plan the best possible sightseeing routes with the best sightseeing locations. Using the intuitive approach only, is not enough in the modern tourism industry. The focus of the presented research is an innovative approach to identify the most prosperous urban places that should be included in urban tourist offers. Empirical research was conducted, based on the analytical method of mental mapping. For the research location, Maribor city (Slovenia, eu) has been chosen. A sample of 200 respondents was taken. They were asked to draw a city map twice, once for the daytime city and once for the nighttime city. Graphical results obtained reflect a subjective mental spatial idea of individual thinking mode. Some locations in the city seem to be particularly important and visible. They were named 'Pillars of Spatial Sensitivity' or, pss locations. pss locations are extremely suitable to be integrated in a tourist offer as building blocks of sightseeing routes. When processing the research results, 34 pss locations were more or less frequently detected in Maribor city. 32 of them had different appearance frequency between day and night. Based on these results, it is possible to conclude that modified spatial circumstances affect the perception and utilisation of urban space. The research results make it obvious that spatial sensitivity of tourists depends on time. It is possible to design sightseeing routes adapted to the time component.\",\n",

If it is based on organizational functions, stakeholders need to be coordinated, and the state plays a major administrative role. But in the successful case of Yeongdong County, Chungcheongbuk province, the Republic of Korea, the government played an important role in the development of tourism, which grants us another perspective on the role of the government in promotion and development agrotourism activities. Methods: This article aims to examine the development of agrotourism through a cooperative approach, by clarifying the role of the local authorities in the Yeongdong region in the management and operation of the local agrotourism activities. The qualitative research method is based on a field survey conducted in Yeongdong County in 2019. Results: The studys findings show that in situations where conflicts of interest among stakeholders are prone to occur, the development of local tourism has a limited impact on the cooperative culture, and local governments play an important role. Accordingly, the local governments must actively formulate strategies to maintain and develop traditional agricultural industries and at the same time develop agrotourism activities. The government's ability to coordinate, cooperate, and participate reasonably is a key factor for the success of the sustainable development of the tourism industry. Conclusion: Based on coordination between stakeholders and a reasonable strategic direction, Yeongdong's agrotourism is being effectively deployed. The development of Yeongdong's agrotourism industry has achieved impressive results through an effective strategy, highlighting the important role of localgovernment in the consensus of local communities and collaboration with stakeholders.

More specifically, the objectives of this research were to: (i) determine the dependence and strategies of informal traders on sales and fair prices for their livelihood; (ii) assess price judgement of tourists in two currencies and (iii) determine whether altruism influences price judgement. A mixed-methods approach was followed, where interviews were held with informal craft traders and a questionnaire was electronically administered to 450 international tourists who visited South Africa. The results show that the informal craft traders are supporting extended family members in southern African countries. The informal tourism economy in South Africa therefore plays an integral part in providing a source of livelihood for many migrants. In addition, tourists have inaccurate price judgements, which is more pronounced for lower valued items, and leads to price distortions in the market. We also find that price judgement in the unfamiliar currency distorts the effect of pro-social behaviour on price judgement, with higher levels of altruism only being associated with price overvaluations in the respondents home currency.',\n",

Thus, the UAE MICE industry was among the global leaders before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred. As a result of severe quarantine measures, the majority of destinations all over the world introduced COVID-19-related travel restrictions that were valid until May 2020. In the UAE, like in any other country, the coronavirus pandemic affected every industry, and especially the MICE one. Even though the consequences of COVID-19 have been multiply analysed by many UAE researchers, its global and local impact on the MICE industry, as well as the strategies for MICE companies survival, are described insufficiently. This study aimed to investigate the COVID-19 impact on both the global and the UAE MICE markets and identify a competitive survival strategy for tourism companies on the example of those operating in the UAE. The research revealed that under the conditions of harsh travel restrictions and closed borders, the UAE MICE industry is faced with a sharp reduction of demand. Emirati Airlines, hotels, and other tourism-related businesses have experienced significant material losses. In particular, the drop in scheduled departure flights comprised 82%. The multiplicative analysis performed in the course of the study identified the 5P marketing strategy and an outsourcing method as an optimal solution for MICE companies survival and recovery. The study results can be used by MICE businesses or researchers using specific company and market data for developing strategies aimed at overcoming COVID-related crisis and increasing the competitiveness of MICE companies in particular and the market as a whole.',\n",
              " 'This paper presents a cross-cultural crowdsourcing platform, called OurPlaces, where people from different cultures can share their spatial experiences. We built a three-layered architecture composed of: (i) places (locations where people have visited); (ii) cognition (how people have experienced these places); and (iii) users (those who have visited these places). Notably, cognition is represented as a paring of two similar places from different cultures (e.g., Versailles and Gyeongbokgung in France and Korea, respectively). As a case study, we applied the OurPlaces platform to a cross-cultural tourism recommendation system and conducted a simulation using a dataset collected from TripAdvisor. The tourist places were classified into four types (i.e., hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, and attractions). In addition, user feedback (e.g., ratings, rankings, and reviews) from various nationalities (assumed to be equivalent to cultures) was exploited to measure the similarities between tourism places and to generate a cognition layer on the platform. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the OurPlaces-based system, we compared it with a Pearson correlation-based system as a baseline. The experimental results show that the proposed system outperforms the baseline by 2.5% and 4.1% in the best case in terms of MAE and RMSE, respectively.',\n",
              " 'Trees are tall plants that can live a long time. They mutely attend events of humans for many years, even centuries, and millennia. A forest or a single tree can survive many human generations. When they get old, they can perform the social role as a monument, reminding the value of time and the environment. The present paper is dedicated to the Monumental and Legacy Trees in Sicily. It aims at showing the nexus between the necessary care of veteran trees and the cultural values that the entire society can achieve through their conservation for the present and the future. After the definition of Monumental Trees, the paper deals with the multiple meanings that even a singular tree has in religion, mystics, education, environment, heritage, and also in tourism. The paper gives geographical knowledge on the principal Sicilian Monumental Trees, deepening the fascinating stories of some of the more typical of them. The olive tree is a millennial symbol of the Mediterranean landscape; the almond tree remembers the eternal springtime of Sicily with its very early blossoming in February; oak trees, holm oak, cork oak, and chestnuts are gigantic monuments of the holiness and boldness of Sicilian mountains. The author argues that future life of old trees depends on policies regarding both environment and cultural tourism.',\n",
              " 'Justified on territorial equity criteria, Spain has developed one of the largest high-speed rail (HSR) network in the world. This research evaluates how the opening of a new station affects the number of firms created at provincial level. We estimate differential impacts on firm creation across four different types of activities: service, tourism, knowledge intensive and manufacturing. The use of panel data makes it possible both to test for the dynamic structure in the data and to provide new insights on the territorial impact of HSR effects. Moreover, we develop a methodological procedure to improve the accuracy of small but positive effects. The results point out that being connected to a HSR network may promote firm creation, but this is not always the case. It has a larger effect in the service, tourism and knowledge intensive activities, whereas in the manufacturing sector the impact is almost null. Regarding the territorial impact, we find that the HSR can reinforce the concentration of firm creation in the biggest cities. Additionally, improving short-distance connections can strengthen agglomeration benefits by enlarging metropolitan areas. Finally, HSR would contribute to increasing the level of divergence in terms of firm creation across provinces. Therefore, our work calls for a rethinking of the strategy of basing investment decisions on territorial equity criteria.',\n",

              " 'The purpose of this paper is to explore travel motivations as criteria in the segmentation process of wellness tourists. Data was collected through a self-complete questionnaire on a sample of tourists staying in one out of 15 wellness hotels situated in four wellness tourism regions of the Republic of Croatia. Research was conducted from May through June in 2013. The data were processed using univariate, bivariate and multivariate statistics. Univariate statistics was used for a general description of the sample; bivariate analysis was applied to examine the differences among the clusters, while multivariate statistics was employed in order to determine the factors underlying the travel motivation construct and to discover the clusters. A total of nine travel motivation factors were identified by applying the theory of the push and pull travel motivations (three push motivation factors, and six pull motivation factors). Push travel motivation factors were labelled as Health trend, Relaxation and reward, and Novelty; pull motivation factors related to a wellness tourist product were labelled as Basic wellness, Intangible wellness, and Extra wellness, while pull motivation factors related to tourist destination were labelled as Cultural and natural heritage, Entertainment and recreation, and Landscape. Three clusters emerged by using travel motivation factors as segmentation criteria (high wellness, immaterial wellness, and low wellness clusters). Relaxation, wellness infrastructure and natural resources are important factors in wellness tourism research. However, both push and pull motivation factors are important variables in distinguishing among the segments.',\n",
              " 'The territory of Gargano is recognized for its stunning landscapes and the ecological variety of its natural spaces, both within the boundaries of the National Park and outside, especially in small villages such as Vico del Gargano. The natural heritage is a fundamental vector of tourist attractiveness, almost a real brand image. Despite the importance of the territorys tourism economy, natural resources are often scarcely valued. In order to maintain the level of quality of reception and, at the same time, the environment, the preservation of areas with high ecological value together with the structuring elements of the landscape is essential, while maintaining a dynamic economic activity. Reconciling productivity issues, both in the short and medium-long term, and preservation of biodiversity is not always easy and obvious. It is vital to capitalize on the natural wealth of territories to leverage the development of the tourist economy, through concrete actions and policies aimed at accompanying economic actors and enable them to put in place best practices to protect the environment and value biodiversity, all towards the sustainable development of territories. The recovery and preservation of the traditional agricultural activities is certainly an economical as well as a socio-cultural issue, and plays a fundamental role in shaping the mentioned agricultural landscapes in such a way as to foster tourism development. As a matter of fact, it is quite difficult to imagine tourists willing to visit big plantations or orchards and tents, which look like industrial sheds; the traditional campaigns, the surviving ones, continue to be, as it has always been, ideal places for an authentic experience of rediscovery of values, tastes, smells and ancient varieties, of excellent products. All this sort of cultural upheaval is something certainly complex, a sign of a real turning point that is investing every sphere of human knowledge, the recognition of the mentioned landscapes as reservoirs of biodiversity and cultural heritage. This is particularly true and important in the context of small villages, whose fragile wealth of knowledge, adaptive mechanisms, resources that cultural landscapes preserve, all play a strategic role. It is of particular interest to analyse how agricultural landscapes, conceivable as cultural landscapes, become an expression of the continuous integration between human activities and natural dynamics; they embed elements of beauty, of naturalness, of scenic quality, that continue to exert strong attraction, thus playing a strong social, cultural and historical role, as well as representing a legacy of knowledge that enables the modelling of sustainable farming. The actual challenge of sustainable tourism initiatives is precisely that of bringing economic capital, cultural capital and environmental capital at the same level of importance and consideration. In the context of the Club of the Borghi pi belli dItalia, founded in 2001 and conceived within the Tourism Council of the A.N.C.I. with the aim of enhancing and promoting the great heritage of history, art and culture present in the Small Italian villages, Vico Del Gargano represents a unique treasure of different relevant possibilities to develop an effective sustainable tourism, aimed at reconciling cultural heritage and environment and biodiversity safeguard. As a member of a list of about 280 villages belonging to the Club, all certificated on the basis of a specific regulation, expression of the best Made in Italy and Italian excellence, Vico Del Gargano embeds high potential resources to enhance its great heritage of history, art, culture, environment and traditions, mostly excluded from the traditional flows of visitors and tourists. The present contribution aims at an initial overview of the state of the art concerning landscape analysis. Furthermore, the main scope is to propose a methodological analysis through the use of landscape ecology approaches, as well as the creation of innovative paths for an effective bottom-up valorization, to be carried out as to involve all the local stakeholders. Numerous small villages in Italy, and Vico Del Gargano as well, are in danger of depopulation and consequent degradation, due to a marginal situation, compared to the economic interests that gravitate around the mass tourist and commercial movements. The proposition aims to select a tourist circuit of excellence, as indicated by the mentioned Club, constantly monitored and evaluated, capable of reconciling both architectural and/or natural heritage, a heritage that is appreciated for its urban and architectural quality, as well as for its natural and environmental wealth. Furthermore, the role of the Consortium of Producers of the Borghi pi belli dItalia Ecce Italy brings together the excellent activities of the eno-gastronomy and crafts in the member villages, with particular reference to guided tours and events related to local products (Cf.: https://borghipiubelliditalia.it/category/puglia/). It is vital to foster the creation of ad hoc routes to promote local products and enhance biodiversity safeguard. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the present proposition is in strict compliance with the initiative of the Ministry for Cultural Heritage and Activities MIBACT, that dedicated the year 2017 to the Borghi and with the Save Borghi law (6th October 2017, No. 158), a series of concrete actions, ranging from infrastructural interventions, to digital strategies and accessibility, to corporate policies, aimed at revitalizing sustainable tourism in small villages such as Vico Del Gargano.',\n",
              " 'Rural areas and in particular mountain territories have been experiencing an increasing appreciation of natural and heritage resources and their use for recreational and leisure activities, boosting tourism development and generating renewed functions with economic and social impact. Inland waters are becoming increasingly important for leisure and tourism, with many activities associated and many users seeking for them. Fluvial beaches represent leisure facilities for rural communities, allowing people and visitors access to aquatic spaces for leisure, sport and entertainment, creating conditions for enjoying nature and water resources, particularly during the summer period. The supply of surface water resources - rivers, lakes and canals - in the territory of the Estrela Geopark in Portugal, represent a tourist potential for this mountain region. They qualify the offer and constitute recreational attractions appreciated by the community and tourists, generating social well-being and fostering new services. There is a growing demand for these spaces, allowing the upgrading of fluvial areas, generating new features and enhancing the image of the destination Serra da estrela. The greater part of this equipment is operated by public entities linked to local administration, thus benefiting from public investment and support. There is a strong perception of its importance in attracting tourists, in improving the quality of life of the local population and in the opportunity to expand trade and service activities. Also in the image of the community, and their self-esteem is perceived, the importance of river beaches and consequently the disclosure that they associate, in terms of environmental quality, heritage value, and space of tranquillity.',\n",
              " 'Park-people relationships are crucial for the effective operation of national parks (NPs). According to this new paradigm, protected areas are increasingly considered as instruments for regional development, particularly in marginal regions. However, park-people relationships often comprise conflicts. We tried to understand park-people relationships through the views and attitudes of local people living in or around the area of the Slovak Karst NP, which is found in a marginal, less developed region within Slovakia. We carried out a questionnaire survey and applied multidimensional statistical methods for the results. We identified four attitude dimensions and six local people clusters. Clusters were compared in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, views on NP tasks, attitudes towards the NP, tourism and nature, as well as migration intentions. We found that 45% of the sampled population had positive attitudes towards the NP and nature, 29.5% were neutral and 25.5% had somewhat negative feelings. Results showed that the personal economic situation, the relationship with tourism, age, education level and profession all influence the attitude of local people towards the NP. As for the socio-economic development of the region, we found that till now, the Slovak Karst NP had only a limited role. Nonetheless, understanding the views and attitudes of local people may help to refine the NP strategy. Results suggest that NP management should strengthen the interaction with local communities and improve resource efficiency through a participatory approach to preserve natural values, improve the quality of life and stop outward migration from the region.',\n",
              " \"The paper critically explores public land privatisation and commodification as a particularly significant field of changing social relations. It focuses on Albania's southern coast as it changed from an area of rural communities with light vacation and recreation activities and re-oriented itself towards international migration networks, intensifying coastal tourism, and the gradual making of the Albanian Riviera. By providing empirical evidence from fieldwork in the area of Himara, along with a review of the legal framework, and through the theoretical lenses of neo-liberalism and post-socialism, the paper investigates two episodes of public land privatisation and commodification: first, the de-collectivisation of cooperative agricultural land in the 1990s, and second, the long-term leasing of public land for large-scale tourism development since the mid-2000s. Analysing these two episodes sheds light on how the state provided the respective legal frameworks so as to open up differentiated land markets, and on the close relationship between the making of the Albanian Riviera, the restitution of private ownership, and the unmaking of common and collective social relations and significations. In turn, the paper argues that public land privatisation and commodification have destabilised and qualitatively changed social relations centred on the land which had survived from the pre-socialist and the socialist eras, by turning them into primarily commodity relations. This has also heightened multiple social tensions and conflicts, leading to a multiply-contested rural space and the rise of new social stratifications, polarisations, and inequalities in the post-socialist era.\",\n",

The target group is composed of the staff working in the food and beverage departments of hotels and restaurants in the tourism industry. Between the period September 2018 and December 2019, long-term and short-term training was given to 1150 personnel and the memorability of the training content was checked during controls. Research data were collected by the researchers with face-to-face interviews through a questionnaire form. Data analysis was carried out by using the SPSS 15.0 statistical package (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). As a result of the study, it was concluded that long-term training stimulated a positive change in food safety and, hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practices (p < 0.001), and the permanence was verified during controls. Even though short-term training also had a positive changes in food safety and hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practices (p < 0.001), no significant difference was observed and the permanence could not be verified during controls (p > 0.001).

The reason behind conducting this study is for presenting the abilities of geo-tourism development in Asir Mountains. The geomorphological heritage embraces landforms and processes playing a key role in the understanding the history of earth and having a strict relationship with both the geomorphological and cultural heritage. The geomorphological heritage is unique and distinctive within the geo-heritage and has promoted great interest over time from a touristic viewpoint. Geomorphological heritage is more than ever in a position to become a significant sustainable territorial resource, enhanced through geo-tourism. A heritage geomorphology emerges, which are not only the characterization of the geomorphological heritage, but also methods of protection and management. In order to analyze geomorphological features of this area and to achieve a digital map, a GIS database created by using both of topographic and lithological maps and satellite images. Using these datasets, the main geomorphologic features extracted and realized based on two stages. First stage is consisted of field campaigns to collect morphological information, and selection of significant geomorphologic sites was based on field survey and study of relevant literature, which chose ten geomorphologic sites.

              " 'The aridity and geographic isolation of the region currently occupied by the State of Baja California Sur have determined its status as a sparsely populated region for most of its history, which has allowed the ecosystems therein to remain pristine or little impacted. Nevertheless, the State has not been immune to the global trend of vigorous population growth in coastal regions. This trend became evident in La Paz city since the 1990s (population as of 1995: 158,800; as of 2015: 253,021 inhabitants), caused by a tourism-driven economy that has led to accelerated, unplanned urban sprawling (urban area as of 1995: 44.7 km2; as of 2017: 85.7 km2). The objective of this study was to identify and analyze anthropic effects on the geomorphology and morphodynamics of the coastal zone, starting with the geomorphological reconstruction of the likely original conditions, followed by an analysis of the population growth and economic activities leading to urban expansion, to finally elucidating their effects on and the evolutionary response of the coastal zone. We used linear regression methods for analyzing geomorphological and morphodynamic changes from historical documents, particularly those that are, or can be, georeferenced such as maps, aerial photographs, and satellite images. This allows utilizing both methods over long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales. Linear regression methods used all the shoreline location data points available to identify changes over time and estimate evolutionary rates. One distinctive advantage of linear regressions is the possibility of using coastlines as delineated from aerial photographs or historical maps, since beach profiles encompassing long-term, large (kilometer) spatial scales are usually not available. The study area comprises two distinct geomorphological units - the alluvial plain and the coastal zone - subject to increasing anthropic activity as evidenced by urban expansion over time. This affects the geomorphological environment, causing major changes in the physical environment, such as fragmentation in parcels and streets, deforestation, and land leveling, as well as the diversion and filling of streambeds. The direct effects of anthropogenic activities on the coastal zone lead to the alteration and partial or total loss of coastal ecosystems such as coastal plains, marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, caused by the construction of tourism infrastructure including hotels, marinas, docks, golf courses, and buildings ranging from residential areas to car junkyards. At the same time, the effects of human activities on the alluvial plain indirectly impact the coastal zone through the reduction of the effective runoff area caused by unabated urban expansion. This, in turn, impairs the sedimentary balance that gave rise to alluvial coastal environments, in which the intensity of the dynamic agents (such as wind, tides, and waves) acting on the coastal zone remained constant. These agents have been acting with the same intensity but, in the absence of sedimentary material, conditions have changed sufficiently to affect the morphodynamics of the coastal fringe of the La Paz lagoon. The evolutionary trend of the La Paz lagoon shows that it has experienced an erosive process at a rate of 0.00227 km2 over 44 years (from 1973 to 2017, or 0.3 m/ year). Paradoxically, the poor or nil urban growth planning is not only causing the loss of the resources that support tourism activities, but is also exacerbating the vulnerability to flooding events in La Paz city and surrounding suburbs. Therefore, it is crucial to properly weigh the benefits of continuing building hotels, marinas, golf courses, residential areas, and other types of infrastructure, versus those of conserving marshes, mangrove swamps, beaches, and dunes, whose proper use and management would contribute to the sustainable economic and environmental development of the region.',\n",

These activities have been reconceptualised as consumptive because of their impacts on the wildlife, and the problem of managing WT as a common-pool resource issue. We use an individual-based model to simulate the dynamics of a WT destination in different development phases. We then ask if any of the governance structures commonly proposed to solve common pool resource issues are appropriate to sustainably manage a WT destination during its development. The level of specialisation of tourists visiting a destination can influence both the exploitation of the wildlife and the socio-economic success of the industry, and no single governance structure leads to sustainability in every stage of a WT destination lifecycle. Given the dynamics of WT destinations, an adaptive governance framework is crucial to avoid wildlife depletion and economic failure of the industry.',\n",

The importance of the latter  particularly for many women  and increasing pressure on these resources, raise sustainability concerns. If natural resource environments are to be protected, restrictions  some of which are already in place  need to be not only enforced but possibly extended. This could, however, impact negatively on these dependent livelihoods. This article considers this dilemma in the context of two Fijian villages in the district of Ba, where women depend on the mangrove areas, primarily for catching crabs for sale in the local markets, using the money earned to meet basic needs.',\n",
              " 'In recent years, autonomous vehicles have received increasing attention and many studies in the literature have discussed the potentialities and the opportunities they could offer. Despite the potential benefits, mainly related to the expected reduction in accidents and congestion phenomena as well as the potentially improved social inclusion of people with driving difficulties (e.g., people with physical disabilities or elderly people), many aspects remain to be addressed, mainly for understanding users acceptance in the case of collective transport vehicles. This study proposes an analysis based on a survey aimed at exploring users preferences with respect to the use of autonomous shuttles (ASs) for tourism purposes. The main correlations between the variables considered and the preferences of potential users have been discussed. Interviewees expressed high confidence in AS technology, although the analyses performed about willingness to pay show that users give more relevance to the provided transport services than the AS technology.',\n",
              " 'Amsterdam is a culturally rich city attracting millions of tourists. Popular activities in Amsterdam consist of museum visits and boat tours. By strategically combining them, this paper presents an innovative approach using waterborne autonomous vehicles (WAVs) to improve the museum visitation in Amsterdam. Multi-source urban data including I Amsterdam card data and Instagram hashtags are used to reveal museum characteristics such as offline and online popularity of museums and visitation patterns. A multi-objective model is proposed to optimize WAV routes by considering museum characteristics and travel experiences. An experiment in the Amsterdam Central area was conducted to evaluate the viability of employing WAVs. By comparing WAVs with land transportation, the results demonstrate that WAVs can enhance travel experience to cultural destinations. The presented innovative WAVs can be extended to a larger variety of points of interest in cities. These findings provide useful insights on embracing artificial intelligence in urban tourism.',\n",
              " 'The paper explores the industrial tourism development potential of a former mining area in Petrila, Jiu Valley, Romania, drastically affected by deindustrialization, in order to build a theme park in the old mine site. The research context is determined by the current economic and social state of the area, and also by the potential of the identified industrial heritage elements. For this reason, there was developed an optimal selection algorithm, based on multi-criteria analysis and Greedy approach. This optimal selection algorithm blends the objectivity of the technical-economic studies and the subjectivity of the residents perceptions of community satisfaction. After carrying out the Petrila case study, the results of the proposed algorithm application concerning the destination, from the point of view of their use, of each existing building in the Petrila site was determined. Compared with other studies, ours considers different criteria and can always be reapplied to validate or refine the selection based on new emerging inputs.',\n",
              " 'This review draws pragmatic lessons for developing countries to address COVID-19-induced recessions and to sustain a developmental recovery. These recessions are unique, caused initially by supply disruptions, largely due to government-imposed stay-in-shelter lockdowns. These have interacted with falling incomes and demand, declining exports (and imports), collapsing commodity prices, shrinking travel and tourism, decreasing remittances and foreign exchange shortages. Highlighting implications for employment, wellbeing and development, it argues that governments need to design comprehensive relief measures and recovery policies to address short-term problems. These should prevent cash-flow predicaments from becoming full-blown solvency crises. Instead of returning to the status quo ante, developing countries capacities and capabilities need to be enhanced to address long-term sustainable development challenges. Multilateral financial institutions should intermediate with financial sources at low cost to supplement the International Monetary Funds Special Drawing Rights to lower borrowing costs for relief and recovery.',\n",
              " 'Adopting a supply-side perspective, the paper analyses Bulgarian hotel managers perceptions of service robots using a convergent mixed methods design. Structured quantitative data were collected from 79 managers using a questionnaire, while interviews were used for the collection of qualitative data from 20 managers. The findings indicate respondents feel that repetitive, dirty, dull, and dangerous tasks in hotels would be more appropriate for robots, while hotel managers would rather use employees for tasks that require social skills and emotional intelligence. The individual characteristics of respondents and the organisational characteristics of the hotels they currently worked in played little role in their perceptions of service robots. The managers considered that robots would decrease the quality of the service and were generally not ready to use robots. Additionally, the interviewees indicated that skilled and well-trained employees were more valuable and more adequate than robots for the hospitality and tourism industry. Theoretical and managerial implications are provided as well.',\n",

However the statistical data on the development of these small regions is available from official statistics, there is no study known to the authors which has analysed the mutual dependencies between the tourist development of poviats (understood either as the historic rate of development or the current state of development) and their natural potential for development. Moreover, the research and data available are not coherent methodologically because they are based on single indicators or variables. Authors study seeks to be more general because it combines popular tourist development indicators. The basic goals are twofold: (1) use multivariate tourist data to assess the development of all poviats; (2) compare this assessment with the tourist attractiveness of poviats. To this end, widely applied and well-known indicators of tourism and development are used, such as Charvats index and Schneiders index. Statistical tools used are graphs and correlation analysis.',\n",

Within this context, our investigation explores recent processes of archaeological research, heritagisation and tourism promotion on Santa Catalina Island that triggered a conflict between the local raizal population (Afro-descendant, Caribbean, Puritan and English-speaking) and the State (white, Andean, Catholic and Spanish-speaking) around the meaning of two key sites of memoryFuerte Libertad (Fort Warwick) and the Cabeza de Morgan (Morgan's Head). Drawing on long-term ethnography, this paper reveals how the neoliberal, multicultural state of Colombia has functioned as an investment facilitator and a key actor in transforming ethnic-racial differences into class inequalities.\",\n",
              " \"Starting an archaeological research is not only the beginning of gathering new scientific data for academic analysis. The role of a scientist is not only to build the 'tower of knowledge,' but also to make it beneficial to people. Therefore, archaeological projects should also vastly contribute to the promotion of the heritage of the region and its modern value and to the development of tourism, education and local community activities. Understanding the local community and its view on the historical heritage, as well as on archaeological research seems to be a very important aspect of this type of activity. It will not only allow to identify potential risks and create a plan of regular research, excavations, as well as future maintenance. As a benefit of the sociological study, the future revitalization of the area will occur. This outcome may be an important extension of theoretical and practical principles of global heritage protection and may become a standard solution based on the belief that cultural heritage can be a factor of local community development and prosperity.\",\n",
              " 'This study developed and tested a model integrating associations of tourist guides, wildlife tourism destination attributes, overall satisfaction and revisit intentions. The study is based on a cross-sectional research survey of tourist guides visiting Lake Nakuru National Park (LNNP) in Kenya, where no such investigation has been conducted before. It was grounded on expectation/disconfirmation theory using attitudinal approach to destination loyalty. Data collection was done through self-administered structured questionnaires. Simple random sampling was used to select the sample size of 298 tourist guides during the study period. Data on socio-demographic characteristics was analysed descriptively while the evaluation of the measurement model was done through exploratory factor analysis and path analysis. The results showed a stronger positive association between wildlife resources and satisfaction, followed by cost of attractions, park image and park accessibility. There was a positive but weak relationship between satisfaction and revisit intention. Therefore, wildlife resources, park accessibility, cost of attractions, and park image dimensions are indicators of satisfaction, but satisfaction was not a good indicator for revisit intentions.',\n",
              " 'Gold has been mined in the area surrounding the small town of Las Juntas de Abangares in Northwestern Costa Rica for over 100 years. Originally through large-scale foreign-based industrial mining operations, now gold is exclusively mined and processed by local, artisanal small-scale gold miners. With the increasing price of gold and the lack of alternative income generating activities over the past 20 years now more than 400 families in this region depend on artisanal gold mining as their only source of income. In this paper, I explore historical and current practices; and opportunities and barriers to achieving sustainability objectives regarding this mining activity within the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. Potential policy, technical, and community development efforts that protect the environment and public health while maintaining or improving income generation for this impoverished community are explored. These include the introduction of mercury-free processing techniques that also increase yield, the formation of cooperatives, vertical integration and product development, the development of gold related tourism, and sustainability certification programs.',\n",
              " 'The purpose of this research was to analyze the visitor-management tactics and strategies in World Heritage destinations. The Temples of Angkor (Cambodia) were selected as case studies. The analysis was carried out in two phasesbefore and after COVID-19. A qualitative methodology was used. Participant observation was employed for the pre-COVID-19 strategies, and recommendations of scholars and bodies responsible for tourism were the basis for the strategies proposed for the post-COVID-19 scenario. Grounded theory and the Atlas.ti qualitative analysis software were used. The results showed that the public health goal, together with its related strategies and tactics, should be added to the classic sustainability goals and the hard and soft strategies (physical, regulatory, and educational). It was also noted that new actors came into play those responsible for public health. In conclusion, this new public health goal and its tactics will condition classic factors such as carrying capacity, and can conflict with goals such as the economic and social goals. The sustainability paradigm is maintained, but with the addition of risk society and the public health goal playing a key role.',\n",
              " 'The sustainable use of Native American heritage places is viewed in this analysis as serving to preserve their traditional purposes and sustaining the cultural landscapes that give them heritage meaning. The research concerns the potential impacts of heritage tourism to selected Native American places at Arches National Park, Canyonlands National Park, and Hovenweep National Monument. The impacts of tourists on a heritage place must be understood as having both potential effects on the place itself and on an integrated cultural landscape. Impacts to one place potentially change other places. Their functions in a Native American landscape, and the integrity of the landscape itself. The analysis is based on 696 interviews with representatives from nine tribes and pueblos, who, in addition to defining the cultural meaning of places, officially made 349 heritage management recommendations. The U.S. National Park Service interprets Natives American resources and then brings millions of tourists to these through museums, brochures, outdoor displays, and ranger-guided tours. Native American ethnographic study participants argued that tourist education and regulation can increase the sustainability of Native American places in a park and can help protect related places beyond the park.',\n",
              " 'This paper describes a proposal for the sustainable rehabilitation of a neglected and marginal fluvial landscape. It situates the experience into a broader debate about sustainability and spatial design, and then draws from it some general conclusion. The study subject is a fluvial valley characterised by thirty-six mills, which once served the agriculture of the surroundings. The decline of water as power source let to the decline of the valley. The mills became eventually farms, houses, or were left empty. The proposal envisions multiple forms of interaction with the different contextual issues related to the context, turning the design of the water course in a way to cope with erosion and floods, to produce clean energy, and finally as attractor for tourism. The result is a series of integrated actions that offers new opportunities to the community, designing a new sustainable landscape drawing from the specific natural and historical aspects of the site. Every action is linked with one of the anthropic and natural factors that characterise the valley, or that can be beneficially introduced, so that the proposal can be further adjusted in accordance with the relative importance of each factor over time.',\n",
              " 'Literary historiography is not indifferent to phenomena that are of key importance to contemporary culture and the humanities, including tourism and travel writing/travel studies. By trying to incorporate the ways a contemporary person experiences the world, literary history uses narrative strategies that are typical of current travel discourse-e. g. of a tourist guide. A tourist guide is an applied genre and also a cultural representation of the literary past of a city or region. The central category for literary tourist guides is space and mobility (rather than timelines and other figures important in a grand literary history). Space functions here as the subject of narration and as the basic principle that orders the material. In that context, the form of a tourist guide is a way of presenting the literary past, remembering the history of the city and its literary works, the lives of writers. Adapting a tourist guidebook for the needs of literary history results from the fact that everyday practices, such as travel and walking, influence professional forms of knowledge. This article shows how academic knowledge (here: literary history) can be learned and popularised by means of a non-academic genre (here: literary tourist guides).',\n",
              " 'Airbnb is currently one of the most developed new forms of hospitality. It is essentially an online platform that connects the owners of apartments or rooms with potential guests. The core of the Airbnb model is the host, who offers a support to guests and favor a link between the guests and the tourism destination. Airbnb awards the best hosts with the badge of Superhost, which is attributed according to four elements: the occupancy rate, the number of reservations, the response rate and the cancellation policy. This paper focuses on hosts and their activities. Specifically, the main goal is understanding if the four aforementioned elements actually influence the attribution of the Superhost badge to hosts operating in two of the main Italian touristic destinations: Sardinia and Sicily. Furthermore, the link between the four basic elements and other managerial factors is analyzed. Logistic and Probit models are used for these purposes and the main findings are derived from the computation of marginal effects. The results show a direct impact of the four Airbnb variables and of other managerial variables, as for instance the presence of extra fees for cleaning or similar services, on the probability to be a superhost.',\n",
              " 'In the northeastern corner of Minnesota, two of the states most iconic symbols, mining and pristine wilderness, are on a collision course. The Duluth Complex, considered by many to be the worlds largest undeveloped deposit of copper-nickel and precious metals, is the site of mining proposals for several controversial mines. Proponents suggest that mining can be accomplished in an environmentally benign manner, and in the process create nearly 1000 jobs and $500 million in economic benefits annually. Opponents counter that the tourism and recreation industries already provide nearly 18,000 jobs and bring over $900 million in economic benefits annually, and that mining will permanently impair the regions environment. Thus, the copper-nickel and precious metal mining debate has become highly polarized, and serves as an ideal example of how people address national and global sustainability issues at local and regional scales. This study examines this polarization through a Q-sort analysis of subjectivities of residents of the state of Minnesota. Results suggest that partisanship is a strong predictor of attitudes towards mining, and that the strongest differences between respondents were not based on perceptions comparing jobs and the environment, the typical partisan divide, but rather on respondents perceived identity with relation to the mining industry or water resources.',\n",

However, efforts have been insufficient to synthesize and integrate the accumulated knowledge of islands ecosystem services. Holistic islands ecosystem services assessments are key to achieve an effective translation of research into decision making, in contexts such as loss of biodiversity and climate change. Using a systematic review of 58 studies published from 1964 to 2019, we identified associations between environments, habitats, ecosystem services, their components and beneficiaries in Islas Marietas National Park (IMNP), marine protected area and international tourist destination in western Mexico. Analysis of occurrence and data visualization were applied to synthesize the information. We identified 12 ecosystem services, the most quantified services being migratory and nursery habitat for species, followed by gene pool protection, recreation and tourism in marine ecosystems, especially in coral reefs. The most quantified component was supply for eight services. Main beneficiaries of knowledge of services were information brokers. We highlighted substantial knowledge gaps and identified constraints to advance knowledge of ecosystem services in IMNP. We proposed steps to incorporate the islands ecosystem services into decision making, and visualized pathways for future social-ecological synthesis research in marine protected areas.',\n",
              " 'The fragmented and sectoral character of conservation as well as development policies has exacerbated the problems faced by small-scale fishers in developing countries. In Ilha Grande Bay (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil), traditional small-scale fishers (Caiaras) has struggled to respond to the contemporary challenges of overfishing and territory loss, which emerged, in part, as consequence of biodiversity conservation and development policies implemented over the last fifty years. In this paper, we aim to explore a sustainable territorial development approach to improve quality of life of fishing communities while conserving the land and seascape that they explore. We first look at the past phases of the development trajectory of Ilha Grande Bay in order to plan for the future. Data collection involved analysis of documentary sources, direct observation in decision-making arenas, and semi-structured interviews. We analyzed four periods from the development trajectory, focusing on small-scale fishing. Our findings show that the set of policies reviewed has strengthened the connections between biodiversity loss and poverty over the years. The viability of STD strategies depends on the recognition of the complexity of interactions among fisheries, environmental protection and tourism, and on the need to create a supply chain that adds value to fishery products which sustain livelihoods and has low environmental impact.',\n",

Field investigations in the Dakhla Oasis of the Western Desert have permitted to assess unique geomorphological, geological, and geoarchaeological features co-occurring in the Valley of Camels. These features are assigned to geomorphological type (animal-shaped landforms sculptured by differential erosion), palaeogeographical type (continental facies of the Cretaceous sandstones and petroglyphs left by the past societies and partly suitable to palaeoenvironmental interpretations), sedimentary type (cross-bedding and multiple truncation planes in sandstones), and hydrogeological type (Roman wells). The Valley of Camels is a globally ranked geosite of complex type. It demonstrates coincidence of essentially different features. For instance, the Toutam landform is notable by its unusual shape resulting from weathering, it exhibits cross-bedding and multiple parallel truncation planes typical for continental sandstones, and it bears petroglyphs near its base. In the Valley of Camels, the geoheritage can be used as the resource for (geo)education and (geo)tourism. Excellent visibility and high aesthetic properties make the proposed geosite suitable to tourists with different geological knowledge or even without it. Geotourism development in the Valley of Camels can contribute to the local sustainable development via providing socio-economic benefits to the local community and strengthening the oasis integration into the Egyptian economy.',\n",
              " 'The Covid-19 global pandemic posed a particularly acute problem for sport. Although there was massive sectoral disruption in areas like higher education, music, and tourism, sport is unusually dependent on commercial media-financed, impossible-to-repeat live events performed before large co-present crowds that form a key part of the spectacle for the many times larger, distant audiences using an expanding range of screens. Covid-19 exposed the inner workings of sport as a machine that could be disabled by its own global interdependency. The compulsive generation of inequalities of class, race/ethnicity, gender, sexuality, age, ability, space, and so on resulting from the advanced commoditisation and consequent hierarchisation of contemporary global sport, created the structural imbalance and vulnerability that Covid-19 has mercilessly punished. This article applies a sociological analysis to sport before, during and after the pandemic, arguing that an emphasis on the relationships between human rights and cultural citizenship is required to improve the social institution of sport. It argues that if sociology does not play a key role in reforming sport after Covid-19, then it will have lost the moral compass that first guided the discipline in early modernity when the institution of sport emerged.',\n",
              " 'National parks are under attack in many parts of the world, including Brazil, which the Convention on Biodiversity ranks as the worlds most biodiverse country. Brazil has been experiencing an unprecedented environmental crisis, and the political situation in the country favors approval of environmentally damaging measures by both the legislative and executive branches of government. A new and largely unreported setback is a proposal in the National Congress for a road cutting the Iguau National Park in two. Here, we identify environmental threats from the proposed road and pressures on the park from the surrounding human population. The proposed laws violate Brazils constitution and would cause immeasurable damage to the parks biodiversity and associated ecosystem services. The road would reduce the cost of transport between two municipalities (counties), but not the cost of transporting soybeans, their main agricultural product. However, the local population would be better served by strengthening its ties to the park and promoting economic alternatives such as tourism, agroforestry, and organic agriculture. The Caminho do Colono road illustrates the danger posed by downgrading the status of protected areas in order to allow environmentally damaging activities. This trend is occurring in many countries and is especially evident in Brazil.',\n",
              " 'This article explores the working of the cultural literacy concepts of rhetoricity and textuality in Michel Houellebecq\\'s third novel Platform through the lens of French philosopher Frederic Lordon\\'s affect theory, with a view to understanding the way emotions and motion operate jointly through writing in this post-travel literature text dealing with the contemporary travel industry, sex tourism, and emotional alienation. As such, it contributes to the current reassessment of the role played by emotions in human interactions. By exploring the specific layered textuality of Platform, which purposefully recycles a series of discursive cliches and tropes, I show how Houellebecq\\'s writing style demands to be considered not only for its literary value but also for its potent, and perhaps unexpected, moving effects, or rhetoricity, which invite readers to reconsider their perception of alterity-i.e. the world and the other-but also of the performative power of art and literature. In order to demonstrate this, the article looks first at the failure of travel writing orchestrated in the novel; it then analyses alternative textual modalities of affect mediation trialed in the text; and finally, it considers the strategies used in Platform to \"empowerise\" signs and, as a result, those who read them.',\n",
              " 'During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, there was a boom in the different forms of material culture of the photographic image with the emergence of cheap methods for its mass (re)production. The material culture extended into postcards, illustrated books, magic lantern slides and stereoviews, but also into the much-less discussed area of souvenir china. These commodified objects of illustrated porcelain were popular mementoes of places visited, physical reminders of spaces encountered, made possible through newly developing modes of leisure culture and organized travel. Edwardian New Zealand was no exception, where images of the Mori were a striking presence within its visual culture. This was a country that was beginning to promote its cultural uniqueness partly through its Indigenous population, with early tourism literature referring to the country as Maoriland. New Zealand souvenirs depicted images of the Mori and Moritanga (Mori culture) on decorative china essentially for consumption by local tourists and travellers. This article considers these commodified objects in the context of photography as material culture, exploring their social biography and the manner in which the images were reproduced and altered. It contends that in addressing keepsake china as objects bearing photographic images, and in positioning these souvenirs as popular artefacts within a scopic culture, a more complex argument of variant readings emerges.',\n",

Malaysian hoteliers refer to three standards when offering Muslim friendly hotel services, which are namely the MS 2610: 2015 Muslim Friendly Hospitality Services Requirements, Crescent Rating Standard and Salam Standard. Moreover, CrescentRating Standard and Salam Standard have become standards for assessing Muslim friendly hotels at the international level. This study evaluated these standards in terms of their adherence to the Maqasid Syariah principle. Criteria for fulfilling these standards were presented and analyzed according to the five kulliyyat found in the Maqasid Syariah, such as protection of religion, life, intelect, lineage and wealth. Findings show that these standards strongly emphasize criteria related to safeguarding religion, such as performing prayers and fasting; safeguarding lives, such as consuming halal food; safeguarding the mind, such as abstaining from consuming alcohol beverages as well as safeguarding familial lineage, such as separating individuals according to their gender in swimming pools and spas. However, safeguarding lives, from the self-security aspect, and safeguarding property were not part of the criteria that determines the standards even though both these criteria are the fundamental needs of hotel guests. The failure to include these criteria has made these standards lose their holistic nature as well as become incapable of becoming evaluating standards that are completely detached from contemporary conventional standards.',\n",

This paper exposes the most important effects of measures that countries have decided on to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Some of these measures led to the availability of the conditions of force majeure, in cases that lead to the impossibility of implementing labor contracts, whether it was a permanent or temporary impossibility, in whole or in part. On the other hand, other measures have created conditions for applying the theory of unpredictability that led to rebalancing the obligations and rights of employers and workers so that workers alone do not bear the all of the negative consequences of these measures, thus it is important to highlight the role of the state in compensating employers for their losses that were paid in workers salaries. This paper also includes the adequacy of the current labor and social security laws to address the effects of epidemics on workers and employers, and concludes with a number of recommendations related to amending labor and social insurance laws to fill the legislative deficiency related to labor relations and protect workers in times of epidemics.',\n",
              " 'Despite the important role of cognitive capital as a facet of social capital, there is little empirical work examining the causal effect of cognitive capital dimensions on sustaining customer satisfaction. Thus, there is a need to investigate the relationship between these constructs via employee self-efficacy. Our proposed hypothetical framework is tested in the tourism industry sector employing a quantitative research method. Drawing from social capital and social cognitive theories, we generated items from a piloted questionnaire which was administered to 600 top and middle managers in hotels and travel agents using drop and collect methods. We test our hypothetical model using SEM techniques with 490 usable cases. The survey results indicate that cognitive capital dimensions have direct and indirect relationships with sustained customer satisfaction. In addition, employee self-efficacy mediates between exogenous constructs and the endogenous construct. Surprisingly, these two exogenous constructs: shared norms and shared values do directly influence shared goals and enhance employee self-efficacy. Additionally, shared goals enhance employee efficacy which subsequently leads to sustained customer satisfaction. These findings shed light on the impact of intra-firm social interactions on customer experience in hotels and travel agents. Managers should use cognitive capital to improve the level of service employee self-efficacy and subsequently sustain customer satisfaction. The paper outlines theoretical and managerial implications and addresses possible directions for further research.',\n",

Modern festivals are spread all over the world, not only changing the rhythm of daily life but also bringing more development possibilities for the places where these festivals are held. In order to learn more about tourists experiences in emerging events, a detailed study of famous hot air balloon festivals was conducted in Taitung City, Taiwan. Based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship among these three constructs, namely stimulus: perception of marketing strategies and motivation, organism: positive emotions and satisfaction and response: revisit intention. Face-to-face surveys were conducted on-site in 2014 and 2018, a total of 896 valid questionnaires were collected from tourists who visited the Taiwan International Balloon Festival. SPSS Macros PROCESS was used to examine the measurement model. This study confirms the application of the S-O-R model in predicting tourists revisit intentions in the context of emerging events in the tourism industry. The survey results show that whether in 2014 or 2018, tourists satisfaction and tourists positive emotions can mediate the relationship between tourists perception of marketing strategies (or tourists motivation) and tourists revisit intention. Moreover, only in 2018, tourists visiting frequency can moderate the relationship between satisfaction and revisit intention.',\n",

In many places, hotels function as a driving force for socio-economic development, serving as employers for the local population, but also providing space for meetings, conferences, private/family events, and ceremonies. Unfortunately, the hotel industry is also considered an industry characterized by the consumption of considerable amounts of resources. These include mainly energy and water consumption, but also waste production. Emphasis is placed on the role of the communication between the various players involved in the operation of hotels.

Previous research has documented how this high level of visitor use negatively impacts park resources and inhibits the provisioning of recreational ecosystem services to park visitors. This research informs the management of recreational ecosystem services in wildland protected areas by identifying important provisioning areas, degraded provisioning areas, and at-risk provisioning areas through a participatory mapping exercise conducted with park managers and other key residential stakeholders (e.g., tourism operators, NGOs, and local community leaders) in Grand Canyon National Park. Following a mixed methods design, responses were analyzed via overlap, hotspot, and qualitative metadata analyses. Findings indicate that unique bundles of recreational ecosystem services are provisioned in specific areas across the study area. However, many of these service provisioning areas were also found to be either degraded or at-risk of degradation due to visitor use trends. Based on perceived service provisioning and degradation, areas of concern for recreational ecosystem service management were subsequently classified. Finally, sources and impacts of degradation for areas of concern were identified through a paired qualitative analysis of the spatial participatory mapping data. As a result, this manuscript outlines a new method of prioritizing areas for recreational ecosystem service management through an areas of concern analysis that examines the overlap of service provisioning areas and ecological and experiential degradation.',\n",

Participants environmental attitude, frequency of contact with nature, and self-reported ecological behavior revealed that they have a strong environmental attitude towards nature (96 %) and positive ecological behavior (92 %) after recoding the variables into negative, neutral and positive responses. Moreover, type of school (public or private), gender, age, environmental attitude and frequency of contact predicted 37.2 % of self-reported ecological behavior scores, with environmental attitude as the largest predictor ( (.499), p = .02), The developed tool can serve as a guide to participatory conservation initiatives and local planning of unprotected biodiversity-rich areas, such as IPAs.\",\n",

There is an urgent need to address these problems as prospects for economic development are inexorably linked to the consequences of environmental degradation and negative social impact. As global awareness of this phenomenon has risen, the attractiveness of firms that take a balanced approach between pecuniary outcomes and sustainable practices has increased. Firms are under pressure to reduce the negative externalities they generate and increase positive externalities. An approach that increases the attractiveness and effectiveness of sustainable ventures can help firms get closer to this goal. We use structuration theory to develop strategy recommendations toward this goal. Structuration theory recognizes the duality of agency and structure, and provides a framework for understanding social phenomena at a meso-level of analysis. The theory describes three structural configurations that have varying levels of influence in social settings. We build upon this theory to argue that the success of sustainable ventures is affected by the degree to which their actions cohere with the strongest social structures operating in their regions. We illustrate our theoretical argument by describing how three sustainable tourism ventures in Central America and three organic foods ventures in Southeast Asia are co-creating social structures that result in positive externalities.',\n",
              " 'There is a need to resolve methods to determine the merits of native versus non-native plant use in drylands and indeed in more temperate areas around the world. This is because whilst plant introductions may have positive objectives, they can have significant negative landscape and environmental impacts. A key discussion on this issue focuses on whether the use of non-native plant species can be considered to be pollution and pollutive based on the concept that pollution can be regarded as matter out of place. The consequences of putting the wrong plant species in the wrong place can be extremely detrimental to the landscape character, quality and value of the land, let alone the effects on ecosystem structure and functioning as well as on biodiversity. These effects can also affect human communities who may rely on the landscape, for example, for tourism. It is thus necessary that the discussion on how decisions are made in determining plant choice evolves so that the right decisions are made when planting is necessary, for the land, for nature and for the people. This discussion has been initiated through COST Action ES1104, which focused on the restoration of degraded dry and arid lands. This article discusses a number of landscape methods based on sustainability principles to determine when and where native and non-native plants could and should be used.',\n",
              " 'Tourism is a key sector in the national economies, representing a real asset for increasing the competitiveness and the world-wide visibility of a Country. In Italy, the widespread diffusion of the tourist heritage represents a great potential for the economic development but requires efforts to identify sustainable and seamless travel solutions, given the limited resources available for tourist mobility. The Italian National Plan of Tourist Mobility identifies in accessibility one of the key drivers for investment, and to this aim has developed a Planning Support System (PSS) to identify the investments to bridge up the accessibility gap of national tourist sites from the main airports, ports and railway stations (i.e. the access gates to the Country), either on the road network or using collective transport services. The PSS is based on the methodology presented in this paper, combining two concepts extensively studied in the literature, i.e. the generalized travel cost and the accessibility, in order to identify where and how to invest either to improve existing mobility services or to build new infrastructure. Given the number of tourist sites scattered over the national territory, the application of the proposed methodology to the Italian case study represents a relevant example of how accessibility measures can be applied in practice to link with policy goals and to identify planning priorities. The application is easily replicable and transferable at regional and local level.',\n",
              " 'As one of the most important transportation infrastructure between cities, high-speed rail (HSR) not only had a huge economic effect on the cities along the route, but also had a certain effect on the economic disparity between cities. Based on the panel data of 40 prefecture-level cities along the main railway in China from 2001 to 2017, the economic effect of HSR is investigated by synthetic control methods (SCM) in this paper. The results show that HSR had the strongest significant positive economic effect on the city with higher economic development level and speed, had significant negative economic effect on the city that facing a negative economic growth, had insignificant weak positive economic effect on the city with lower economic development level and speed. Thus the economic effect of HSR had strong disparity. In addition, in order to explore the reasons for the economic effect disparity of HSR, this study further analyzed the mechanism of the disparity. It is found that the indirect economic effects (accelerating the flow efficiency of factors of production and changing the distribution of factors of production) brought by HSR had positive economic effects in certain cities, but had negative economic effects in some others. And it was the main reason for the economic effect disparity of HSR. By contrast, the direct economic effects of HSR (promoting the development of traffic consumption and tourism industry) often only had positive economic effects, and showed strong consistency in different cities.',\n",
              " 'The mobility of coastal dunes is characterised by bio-geomorphological responses related to change in boundary conditions, particularly sediment supply, wind and vegetation cover, as well as human activities. There remains uncertainty regarding the relative importance of these drivers on dune mobility at a global scale. In this study, trends and dominant drivers of coastal dune mobility are synthesised through the literature review focusing on shifts in dune mobility over the last century (18702018). In total, 176 individual dunes, with 55 dunes from the Europe-Mediterranean area, 23 from Africa, 30 from North America, 23 from South America, 20 from Oceania and 23 from Asia, are reviewed in this work. The results show that there is a worldwide trend of dune stabilisation, with 93% (164 out of 176) of the reviewed sites showing a loss of bare sand area due to an increase in vegetation cover and urbanisation expansion. Multiple factors have contributed to the stabilisation process, including (a) land-use change such as the change of traditional farming practises, coastal urbanisation and tourism development; (b) dune stabilisation projects; (c) sediment decline caused by the riverine and coastal constructions; and (d) change in climate (i.e. the decrease in windiness, and the increase in temperature and rainfall) and storms. Our results suggest human intervention played a dominant role in altering dune mobility for most dunes during the past century, while climate and storms are also important drivers, especially for dune sites with limited human activities.',\n",
              " 'The present study investigates the impact of freedom (i.e. the effects of political rights and civil liberties) on tourist arrivals for the eight countries with the highest tourist arrivals in 2016 (France, the United States, Spain, China, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Mexico), using annual data from 1998 to 2016, through advanced panel data methods. Notably, the key strengths of this study are as follows: (i) it examines the impact of institutional quality on international tourism demand for the most visited countries and (ii) it employs advanced panel data techniques, which have been suggested in recent years. We first constituted a freedom index using political rights and civil liberties data. Second, we performed cross-sectional dependence (CD) tests to examine whether there existed CD in the panel data set. After detecting the presence of CD, we used panel unit root and cointegration tests, which are robust to CD to avoid problems from spurious regression. Finally, we estimated long-run parameters of the empirical model through a panel data estimator that is capable of presenting efficient and unbiased output in the presence of CD. Our empirical findings show that the level of freedom may play a role in explaining the volume of international tourist arrivals. Theoretical and policy implications are discussed in the study, particularly with respect to the importance of rights and freedom in the context of international inbound tourist arrivals.',\n",
              " 'This article is devoted to the transition of the Arab countries to the new concept of sustainable development (SD) in tourism, sea and air transport. The challenges associated with the transition to sustainable development are implemented in state long-term strategies in the Arab countries. The surge of interest to this concept of development was also due to the release of the 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) in 2015, which replaced the Millennium development goals. General questions of the development of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries at the beginning of the 21st century and the main prerequisites for creating large infrastructure facilities in the region owing to the increase of tourist inflow, especially the increasing number of Muslim pilgrims coming to Saudi Arabia, are considered at the beginning of the article. There is a brief overview of the national air carriers and the system of large air hubs in the UAE and Qatar and data on SDG Index No. 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries for 2017 and 2018. The article is concluded with the results of the investigation on the effect that the Persian Gulf monarchies have achieved in the field of passenger and cargo transportation as well as the problems of operating aviation infrastructure facilities in the context of the transition to sustainable development; it is also shown that the economic downturn and the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused the suspension of air travel in a number of countries in the spring of 2020, may have certain consequences.',\n",
              " 'East Kazakhstan is physiographically a diverse region of north-central Asia encompassing a broad array of geomorphic zones and geo-ecosystems from the western open steppes to the interior arid basins with wind-sculptured surfaces of the surrounding rocky highlands aligned by the high alpine mountain ranges. The complex regional geological history gave rise to a mosaic of impressive landforms located within a relatively small area. The extraordinary relief with many unique geo-sites was generated by dynamic processes associated with the late Cainozoic orogenesis in conjunction with the past climatic variations. The cyclicity of bedrock weathering and mass sediment transfer are manifested by Mesozoic fossiliferous formations, large sand dune fields, and loess-palaeosol-cryogenic series providing archives of the Quaternary evolution. Pleistocene glaciations followed by cataclysmic floods from the released ice-dammed lakes during the recessional glacier stages have produced an exceptional imprint in the mountain areas. Many archaeological localities and historic monuments, some being a part of the UNESCO World Natural and Cultural Heritage, are associated with the most prominent topographic places. Geo-tourism focusing on the most exquisite landscapes and spectacular geological settings is the new trend in the country with still minor activities that take advantage of the regions supreme geoheritage potential. The great geo-diversity accentuates the touristic value of this still marginally explored geographic area. Reconnaissance, documentation, and publicity of the most unique geo-sites and geo-parks provide an impetus for their registration in the national and international nature heritage protection programs under proper geo-environmental conservation policies.',\n",
              " 'Economic development in rural areas is commonly tied to the use of natural resources. These uses can be categorized as extractive (e.g. mining, natural gas, and logging) or non-extractive (e.g. real estate, tourism, outdoor recreation, and wind energy). Research has shown local support is crucial for sustainable economic development. Therefore, understanding what drives support can help researchers better understand why some projects succeed where others do not. This becomes increasingly important in the face of global climatic change. Extractive uses of natural resources in rural areas are associated with high volumes of CO2 emissions and will have to be greatly reduced if the United States is to successfully respond to climate change. In their place, non-extractive forms of natural resource development have emerged as possible alternatives in transition. Therefore, understanding the impact of climate change beliefs on support for different forms of natural resource development is beneficial for ensuring equitable plans that reflect the needs and desires of rural residents. Using a cognitive hierarchy framework, we test a model hypothesizing support for extractive or non-extractive development is influenced by climate change beliefs which are influenced by both environmental beliefs and political conservatism. We test our model on a sample of rural Pennsylvanians using structural equation modeling and find mixed support for the model. Notably, anthropocentrism and biocentrism both had positive relationships with both forms of development, refuting hypotheses. Further, belief in anthropogenic climate change had a positive relationship with extractive support, but no relationship with non-extractive support.',\n",
              " 'An effective yet neglected option to limit the detrimental effects of car traffic in natural tourist destinations is the imposition of vehicle quotas. Defining the right quota for a road system, however, may not be straightforward because of the complex connection between the number of vehicles entering the system and traffic levels across space and over time. In this paper, we present a novel approach to tackle this issue that combines agent-based modeling and standards of quality, and we use it to define an hourly quota aimed at limiting traffic congestion and demand for parking along a scenic road in the Dolomites (Italian Alps). The model is designed and calibrated using geospatial and traffic data, and the acceptability of the quotas is further tested according to the hourly modal splits they might induce. Our model simulations highlight that, by redistributing morning traffic inflows, the quota can almost eliminate congestion with only a negligible impact on overall traffic figures. Further, while traffic reductions of up to 35% may be needed to eliminate traffic-related issues, more reasonable reductions (i.e. 1025%) may be enough to address most of those. From an empirical perspective, the paper shows the effectiveness of quotas in sustainable transport and tourism; from a policy and management perspective, it proposes an approach for the definition of an ideal quota. The design of a quota system, however, requires detailed implementation and communication strategies, and more advanced simulation tools to capture circulation patterns induced by such strategies.',\n",
              " 'Marine parks were established to protect the diverse marine ecosystem in Malaysia, and over the years, the islands have attracted an increasing number of tourists. These marine park islands have become not only one of the top ecotourism destinations in Malaysia but an important contributor to the socio-economic growth of the nation. Nonetheless, it is a constant challenge to maintain the marine parks natural charm due to negative tourism impacts. Humans consumption behaviour has been identified as a driver of climate change. Given that humans contribution to the problem is closely related to sustainable behaviour, this study focuses on tourists behaviour. With the growing awareness on global environmental challenges, environmental knowledge has often been prescribed as one of the main precursors of tourists behaviour, yet few studies have attempted to assess this factor from different dimensions. This paper examines tourists environmental knowledge from a multidimensional aspect of factual, conceptual and procedural dimensions to determine its role in influencing attitude and responsible environmental behaviour. A face-to-face survey was conducted among 85 domestic and international marine park tourists, and data were analysed using PLS-SEM method. This preliminary study revealed that environmental knowledge is formatively represented by factual, conceptual and procedural dimensions. Furthermore, results confirmed the linear relationships between knowledge, attitude and behaviour with knowledge as a strong predictor of attitude that leads to higher pro-environmental behaviours, hence highlighting the importance of promoting environmental knowledge among marine park tourists who drives pro-environmental attitude and responsible behaviour to achieve a sustainable ecotourism development.',\n",
              " 'Virtual Reality Technology is increasingly becoming popular in the tourism sector. So far, the most researched application is the marketing of destinations. In contrast, the technology has also been mentioned as a means to limit or reduce the number of tourists at a specific sight or destination. In this respect vr is considered as a substitute for the actual trip. This paper addresses this issue by looking at the possibility to apply vr-technology to transfer the real-life experience into the digital world. In a qualitative research framework, visitor behaviour and experience are investigated when encountering vr sights in order to better understand items driving technology adoption. Structured content analysis is applied for data analysis where coding follows an adjusted Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. For interpretation purposes a pure qualitative framework was chosen. We find that enjoyment is an important driver for vr technology acceptance, whereas facilitating conditions and outcome expectations seem to be obstacles for it. Perceived usefulness is evaluated controversially. While the technology is not acknowledged as a substitute for a regular holiday trip, especially for travellers who take pleasure in active holidays or appreciate social interaction, it was recognised as an alternative for special occasions such as brief getaways from everyday life or short city trips. Overall, when appropriately implemented the technology might not only be useful to decrease visitor concentration in touristic hotspots or to decrease negative aspects associated with frequent travel but could further be applied to sites where visitors do not engage physically because sites are too distant, expensive, inhospitable, unsafe or fragile.',\n",
              " 'The purpose of this article is to describe the model of the most important employee financial participation (EFP) programs and give some proposals aiming at wider promotion of financial participation in tourist companies in order to show the occurring relations between the programs applied and the socioeconomic results of enterprises. The research has been based on available literature and own research conducted on the sample of Polish companies listed on Warsaw Stock Exchange. The authors research could serve as a guide to carry out similar research in the tourist resort. Financial participation programs existing in particular countries differ because of various circumstances in which they are applied, various range and eligibility of employees, though it is possible to find such elements which they have in common. What can be expected is a radical change in workers attitudes towards a higher commitment, stronger identification with the company, and as a result taking responsibility for its future. It is even more important in tourist industry (in transnational tourist companies) in a comparison to the traditional one. It can be assumed that the awareness aspect plays here a vital role in the way to a success of the whole company and individual employees as well. Unfortunately, this is not a common condition. We can expect that EFP programs generally would have a positive influence on the functioning of the tourist enterprise. However, the effects could be rather social than economic. More rigorous statistical analysis is needed to know more about economic results in tourist industry, unfortunately such studies are not conducted in tourism, so the question in the title is still open.',\n",
              " 'Climate change, drought, and chronic overdraft represent growing threats to the sustainability of water supplies in dry environments. The Monterey/Salinas region in California exemplifies a new era of integrated or one water management that is using all of the water it can get to achieve more sustainable supplies to benefit cities, agriculture, and the environment. This program is the first of its kind to reuse a variety of waters including wastewater, stormwater, food industry processing water, and agricultural drainage water. This study investigates the partnerships, projects, and innovations that shape Montereys integrated water network in order to better understand the challenges and opportunities facing California communities as they seek to sustainably manage peri-urban water supplies. Water reuse in the Monterey region produces substantial economic and environmental benefits, from tourism and irrigation of high-value crops to protection of groundwater and increases in environmental flows and water quality. Water resource managers in other communities can learn from Montereys success leveraging local needs and regional partnerships to develop effective integrated water solutions. However, key challenges remain in resolving mismatched timing between water availability and demand, funding alternative water supplies, and planning effectively under uncertainty. Opportunities exist to increase Montereys recycled water supply by up to 50%, but this requires investment in seasonal storage and depends on whether desalination or additional recycling forms the next chapter in the regions water supply story. Regulatory guidance is needed on seasonal subsurface storage of tertiary-treated recycled water as distinct from potable recharge. By increasing the supply of recycled water to Montereys indirect potable use system, the regions potential need for seawater desalination may be delayed as much as 30 years, resulting in cost and energy savings, and giving the opportunity to resolve present planning concerns.',\n",
              " 'In the light of recent emergencies represented by climate change and global warming, with the consequent policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, this research aims at offering a response to the need for decarbonization of anthropization processes of territories, on a building and urban scale. This study elaborates a methodology, according to an integrated qualitative-quantitative approach, which combines the strategic need for sustainable mobility with the need to enhance the value of natural and environmental interesting places, typical of the Mediterranean area and in particular the ones which represented the heart of Magna Graecia. This strategy is implemented through a growing mobility offer in recent years: sustainable cycling tourism, which is included in the wider and more widespread strategic action of greenways. However, these strategies do not often meet the interests of the public administration, which is refractory to face great costs in exchange for a hypothetical return on investment, in the long term; the result is the abandonment and degradation of territories characterized by a remarkable naturalistic, landscape and environmental value. The aim of this study, therefore, is to provide operators in the sector (public administration, Cilento National Park Authority, economic operators, etc.) with a decision-maintenance tool, through the definition of priority criteria for interventions, according to an economic sustainability approach of the intervention and adopting an integrated qualitative-quantitative methodology. The intervention, as a whole, involves a cycle path of about 600 km, passing through 70 countries of the territory. Therefore, assuming the impossibility of being carried out at the same time, as a whole, it has been divided into 23 functional lots: the methodology intends, precisely, to define the priority and necessity criteria that determine the classification of importance of the 23 routes (sub-interventions), identified in this study.',\n",
              " 'In addition to permanent migration, different forms of cross-border mobility were on the rise before the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from tourism to job-related commuting. In this paper ethno-linguistic differences in cross-border mobility using the activity space framework are considered. New segregation theories emphasise that segregation in one part of the activity space (e.g. in residential neighbourhood) affects the segregation in other parts of the activity space (e.g. in workplace), and that spatial mobility between activity locations is equally important in the production and reproduction of ethnic inequalities. Until now, segregation in activity spaces has been studied by focusing on daily activities inside one country. In reality, an increasing number of people pursue their activities across different countries, so that their activity spaces extend beyond state borders, which can have important implications for the functioning of ethno-linguistic communities and the transfer of inequalities from one country to another. This study takes advantage of mobility data based on mobile phone use, and the new avenues provided for the study of ethno-linguistic differences in temporary cross-border mobility. Such data allow the study of different cross-border visitor groupstourists, commuters, transnationals, long-term stayersby providing the means to measure the frequency of visits and time spent abroad, and to link together the travel of each person over several years. Results show that members of the ethno-linguistic minority population in Estonia make more trips than members of the ethno-linguistic majority, and they also have higher probability of being tourists and cross-border commuters than the majority population, paying frequent visits to their ancestral homelands. The connections between ethno-linguistic background and temporary cross-border mobility outlined in this study allows for future discussion on how (in)equalities can emerge in transnational activity space and what implications it has for segregation.',\n",

But still, there was none of the slope reinforcement installed along the road. Meanwhile, at several nearby locations within Southern Mountain, rockfall incidents have occurred many times even caused casualties. The potential of rockfall hazard also could be found in the main road of Parangtritis Beach as the study area. The purpose of this study is to determine the rockfall hazard assessment along the main road using Slope Mass Rating (SMR) analysis with the additional parameter of the slope height and the rock block size. The necessary data obtained by direct measurement and laboratory test. Geomechanics analysis, stereographic projection analysis, and hazard parameters weighting were carried out to produce the Rockfall Hazard Zonation Map of the study area. Based on 17 measurement stations, there are 4 (four) rockfall hazard classes in the study area, i.e., very low, low, moderate, and high. The class of very low, which also included road segments without slope, has the largest percentages of 83.83%, followed by the classes of moderate, low, and high with the percentage of 7.16%, 4.28%, and 4,19%, respectively. SMR was assumed as the most significant parameter that influences the rockfall hazard zonation. Historical rockfall points were overlaid over the Rockfall Hazard Zonation Map to validate the predicted hazard zones. Since 91.23% of the rockfall occurred in the moderate and high hazard classes, the zonation map considered reliable to predict future rockfall. This study also identified several landslide potential zones and provides the recommendation of slope reinforcement to be installed in the study area.',\n",
              " \"The physical evidence is influential on the consumer's attitude, quality perception, and purchasing behavior. The service atmosphere within the physical evidence scope is an element that requires huge investments. Together with low-cost small changes, the physical environment could be rendered much more attractive to the consumer. Color and light are among the elements that are suitable for these changes. This research aims to determine whether the color of light in the service atmosphere affects the customer's quality perceptions and customer satisfaction and whether this effect differs according to the color of light. To this end, the restaurant business, which has an essential place in the tourism industry, was chosen as the research experiment ambient. A total of five experiments were conducted in five ambient lighted in different colors with participants. Data were collected with 204 the form of the experiment question According to the analysis results, the perception of service quality and the level of satisfaction were higher in red and yellow-lighted ambient than those in blue and green-lighted ambient. In line with the results, recommendations were made to reduce the physical environment costs in the service production process in restaurants and to achieve a cleaner service production, sustainable production, and consumption through more efficient use of resources. Highlights: The light color in the service atmosphere affects the perceived quality and customer satisfaction. Perceived service quality and customer satisfaction differ according to the light color in the service atmosphere. By changing the light color in the service atmosphere, it is possible to increase the level of quality perception and customer satisfaction in a positive way. By changing the color of the light in the service environment, efficient and sustainable cleaner production can be realized with low costs.\",\n",
              " 'Safety in an integral sense is a comprehensive tool by which the humans ensure the level of their security and the sustainable development of them and of other basic public assets in a given territory. In addition to individual parts of human system it is necessary to consider their mutual links and flows being among them. One of the sectors in which security plays an important role is tourism. An integral part of it is transportation of persons, but also material and its associated safety. Safety is fundamental to any transport system; it must always be the top priority. The authors of this article focused on one particular specific area: the safety of transporting dangerous goods in the Czech Republic. The main reason was that traffic accidents with dangerous goods have big impacts on goods and vicinity, i.e. humans and environment (Maturo in Ecol Indic 90:305315, 2018). They are accompanied by fire, explosion, leakage of dangerous substances, or combination of these phenomena. These facts have economic impacts on carriers (damage or destruction of goods) and as well as on protected assets at the accident site (damage to infrastructure, human health injury or loss of human lives of persons being in the vicinity, harms in environment). The aim of the paper is to analyse the traffic accidents involving dangerous substances on the motorways and main railway routes in the Czech Republic, to characterize their impacts, to judge response in case of accidents occurrences and on evaluation of real data to suggest the measures for increasing safety in the carriage of dangerous substances. The authors focused on the statistical evaluation of accidents and on analysis of accidents during the transport of dangerous substances from the perspective of the impacts on people and other public assets.',\n",

This article investigates the use of Weibo for big data analysis and its efficiency in various categories instead of manually collected datasets, by exploring the relation between time, frequency, place and category of check-in based on location characteristics and their contributions. The data used in this research was acquired from a famous Chinese microblogs called Weibo, which was preprocessed to get the most significant and relevant attributes for the current study and transformed into Geographical Information Systems format, analyzed and, finally, presented with the help of graphs, tables and heat maps. The Kernel Density Estimation was used for spatial analysis. The venue categorization was based on nature of the physical locations within the city by comparing the name of venue extracted from Weibo dataset with the function such as education for schools or shopping for malls and so on. The results of usage patterns from hours to days, venue categories and frequency distribution into these categories as well as the density of check-in within the Shanghai and contribution of each venue category in its diversity are thoroughly demonstrated, uncovering interesting spatio-temporal patterns including frequency and density of users from different venues at different time intervals, and significance of using geo-data from Weibo to study human behavior in variety of studies like education, tourism and city dynamics based on location-based social networks. Our findings uncover various aspects of activity patterns in human behavior, the significance of venue classes and its effects in Shanghai, which can be applied in pattern analysis, recommendation systems and other interactive applications for these classes.',\n",
              " 'The major impact of hotel industry on the environment has become a serious concern for both hoteliers and tourists, with many studies showing that tourists are having more and more expectations from hoteliers to implement environmental practices. Considering the fact that most hotel bookings are now made online through booking websites, it is important for these to show and manifest the same preoccupation with the environment, by promoting environmentally friendly initiatives. The aim of the present study is to emphasize the crossroads between sustainability and digitalization, and to increase the role of digital technologies in encouraging a sustainable development of all tourism sectors, including hospitality. The study provides information and identifies important elements to assess the environmental practices of booking websites. In order to identify the position that booking websites and platforms take towards the environmental practices, the filter section of four booking platforms is analyzed. The present study aims not only to analyze the current position of booking platforms towards the environment, but also to identify methods that improve the way they highlight their implemented environmental practices, based on tourist reviews. In order to identify the customers opinion regarding these types of practices, a total of 31,800 tourist reviews posted on Booking.com were analyzed. The results have indicated that the level of awareness related to the need of protecting the environment, in the case of both hoteliers and tourists, must increase aspects that also imply the need for booking websites to highlight and encourage environmental practices. The obtained results are useful for booking websites developers who can adapt and make the websites interface friendlier regarding environmental practices. In addition, hotel managers and entrepreneurs can make use of these results in order to develop new types of business in the hospitality industry, and in the long run the results are useful for increasing the awareness among tourists of the need for environmental practices. Suggestions are made on how booking websites can involve themselves more in environmentally friendly initiatives and in potential future study.',\n",
              " 'Seagrass beds in central Vietnam plays an important role in the aquatic ecosystem. The area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham Marine Protected Area (MPA), central Vietnam, has been reported to be declining in recent years. However, there has not been any study on assessing the changes in the area of seagrass beds in Cu Lao Cham MPA, especially by the application of remote sensing technology for evaluating temporal and spatial changes. The aim of this study is to establish the current status and document historical changes using maps of seagrass area in Cu Lao Cham MPA, central Vietnam, during the period of 20032017. This is the first study on assessing the temporal and spatial changes in the area of seagrass beds in central Vietnam using remote sensing technology. The study integrated field surveys, satellite remote sensing and GIS methods to analyse ALOS AVNIR-2 and Landsat satellite image data during the period of 20032017. The Kappa coefficients and overall accuracies of the years 2003, 2010 and 2017 were generally higher than 89% and 0.83, respectively, in all cases. Seagrass beds have mainly distributed near small islands such as Hon La, Hon Tai and Hon Dai. In particular, seagrass beds have almost disappeared at Bai Ong and Bai Huong in April 2017. In the period of 20032017, the area of the seagrass bed experienced significant changes. The seagrass area loss was 40.17ha, and it gained 58.6ha in the period of 20032010. In the period of 20102017, the loss of seagrass area was 68.76ha, and the new addition was 7.27ha. The study has identified a number of impacts of declining seagrass areas including marine pollution, changes in natural conditions and some other direct impacts from human activities and tourism. The results of this study could contribute to conservation of seagrass resources and sustainable livelihood development for the local community.',\n",
              " \"Research background: In the developed countries, the services sector, which also includes the accommodation services, is a significant source of the gross national product. Tourism can be perceived as an important determinant of countries' economies, so attention paid to the needs of clients is at least necessary and beneficial. Purpose of the article: The aim of the study is to assess the quality of services provided and the perception of the hotel from the point of view of the accommodated clients. This objective was fulfilled by determining the effect of selected indicators of perception of the quality of provided services (location, personnel evaluation, cleanliness, equipment, comfort, price/quality ratio of provided services, free Wi-Fi connection) on the indicator determining the perception of the hotel (polarity of sentiment). Methods: In the analysis of the above, 22,000 text-reviews of 117 five-star hotels of the Visegrad Group countries were evaluated. The hotel reviews were obtained from Tripadvisor.com and indicator rankings from Booking.com. The analysis made use of the regression analysis methods - influence (regulatory models - Ridge, Lasso, Elastic net, and multiple linear regression - OLS). Findings & Value added: It has been found out that hotel equipment and cleanliness have the greatest effect on the polarity of sentiment. As could be expected, the trend has an upward tendency - that is, as quality increases, so does the sentiment polarity - the perception of hotel facilities. Overall, the analysed sentiment variables can be considered positive, as was confirmed by the positive coefficients of the coherence analysis (Spearman-; Pearson-r), as well as the upward trend in the predictions under the regression analysis. Hotels should be strategically customer-oriented and, as the analyses show, pay the greatest attention to equipment and cleanliness. The services of accommodation facilities are dominant in terms of satisfaction with the destination in general, so in the long run, they should be given due attention. These findings are particularly beneficial for hotel services provided in the Visegrad Group countries, as no research studies have yet been carried out on customer evaluation of the quality of accommodation facilities using the presented methods.\",\n",
              " \"Since the 1960s, a significant percentage of railway networks have been closed all over the world. This represents a heritage that can be used to provide new features to local communities with regard to sustainable development and landscape regeneration processes. Disused railways can be converted into greenways which are only dedicated to not motorized users and people with reduced mobility. Greenways can also be utilized for leisure, tourism and commuting. The growing interest and social demand for greenways face an obstacle in the form of scarce public funds. Accordingly, decision-makers and land-use planners need to assess the potential benefits and costs for local communities as well as the attractiveness for users. In this paper, we aim to provide a transferable working tool able to support decision-making and land-use planning processes related to the conversion of disused railway lines into greenways in mixed urban-rural contexts. We tested the developed methodology in Piedmont (Italy), a region with almost 600 km of abandoned railway lines and over 200 disused stations. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to carry out the spatial data analysis and an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for integrating the preferences of stakeholders. We defined the Greenway Suitability Index (GSI), a synthetic global index able to take into account and synthetize the characteristics and current conditions of the disused railway networks and the territorial and social contexts (Natural elements, Historical-Cultural resources, Traditional food and local wine, Landscape or Scenery, Accessibility, and Population). Decision-makers can use the GSI to prioritize and concentrate the investments on the sections with the highest score. We defined four scenarios based on the desired prevalent use of the future greenways - namely, touristic versus recreational/daily travel. We then calculated the GSI for each of them in order to verify how the priorities can change in relation to the objectives. The successful application demonstrated that the methodology can be used to calculate a sort of priority score considering the stakeholder's preferences and allowing for the land-use decision-makers to concentrate their investments in a hierarchal way.\",\n",
              " 'Purpose: This study aims to investigate the representation of women managers through a content analysis of related magazine articles within the hospitality industry in the Maldives. Evidence suggests an increase in the number of working women, yet there is relative neglect toward identifying issues involving women in the industry. Design/methodology/approach: Both qualitative and quantitative approaches were used to content-analyze the narrative on the sampled articles from a Maldives-based hospitality magazine, Hotelier Maldives. Qualitative content analysis and quantitative methods report on the challenges faced by women managers and reasons for their success based on the narratives. Findings: This study revealed that although women managers are underrepresented in management, there has been a broad increase in the participation of women within the industry. This study falsified the perception that gender is a limiting factor to hold senior positions in the hospitality industry and that increased participation of women managers may be driven by the changing social and cultural contexts. Originality/value: This study is one of the first to examine how women managers are represented in hospitality magazines. Despite its relevance, previous tourism research has not focused on this kind of measurement.',\n",
              " 'Human trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar industry, which continues to prey upon the worlds most vulnerable countries and populations. Women, children, and increasingly a large number of boys are exploited each day and put into situations of forced labour, sexual servitude, forced marriage and debt bondage. Caribbean nations, many of which have weak political structures, poor governance, and heightened levels of poverty, crime and illiteracy are among the transit and destination countries affected by trafficking. Miles of open unsecured borders and economies that are heavily reliant on tourism represent a haven for undocumented emigrants who are in search of employment and social mobility, and who ultimately fall victim to human trafficking. A lack of compliance by governments who do not abide by global trafficking standards, and inadequate laws and regulations allow many traffickers to go unpunished across the Caribbean region. This paper provides a critical analysis of the nations that are most vulnerable to this human rights issue, governments that are in compliance with global trafficking international laws, strategies for prevention and possible policy recommendations to ameliorate the effects of this crime and human rights abuse.',\n",
              " \"Exploratory Spatial Analysis Techniques (ESDA) have become popular to identify the spatial association of different variables in many fields of natural and social sciences. The application of Global Moran's I statistics enables us to provide visual insights of spatial data. It helps to detect spatial patterns and hotspots of an activity or process, based on spatial autocorrelation. This study aims to investigate the spatial dependence of domestic and inbound tourist arrivals to 123 cities of all eight provinces of the Aegean Region of Turkey. For analysis, city-level data about domestic and inbound tourist arrivals during 2015-2019 is collected from the Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism and is converted to logarithm form to avoid any skewness. The Arc GIS and GeoDa programs are employed for the analysis of spatial autocorrelation and visualization of hotspots of tourist flows in the regions. The results of the study reveal that tourist flows in the region are concentrated in the coastal areas, while inland cities receive an insufficient number of tourists. The hotspots of tourist flow are located mostly in the coastal towns of the provinces of Izmir, Aydin, and Mugla. The study is significant in the provision of useful information regarding resource allocation to the tourism hotspots and the implication of sustainable tourism policy to better utilization of tourism potential.\",\n",
              " 'The relevance of this study is in the growing popularity of the concept of sustainable development in the tourism sector. The purpose of the article is to determine a systematic basis for the assessment of the possibility of sustainable tourism development at the regional level, as well as determining relevant vectors. In addition, the study considers a number of studies that allow for defining sustainable tourism, as well as determining groups of indicators affecting it. The leading method of studying tourism structure as part of a regional socio-economic system is topological analysis, which allows for identifying functionally significant combinations of factors. Incidence matrices of the structure of indicators with included weighting factors influencing the sustainable development of tourism, analysis of their q-connectivity, the results of the dimension of simplexes, the number of connected components and communication chains, the structural vectors of the complexes were determined and presented. The study proved the presence of simplexes in the complexes. The effects on simplexes can bring the desired result in the quickest and most efficient way. Since tourism is an integral part of environmental, social and economic sectors, and the sustainable development itself can be regarded as a unified system of interaction between them, it is possible to use the above factors in each of the sectors on a case-by-case basis in any territory or enterprise to conserve resources, eradicate poverty and ensure well-being. This research attempts to formalize the factors that determine the sustainable development of tourist destination that gives the full basis for a systematic study of the territory to assess the sustainability of tourism development. The topological analysis shows the mutual influence of simplicial complexes by means of a chain of connections leading to sustainable development.',\n",

This study aims to analyze income distribution inequality and factors behind rural households poverty in Kosovo. Data on farm income, nonfarm income, unearned income, and socio-economic characteristics were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire from 203 randomly selected households in Kosovo. Linear regression, one-way ANOVA, and different versions of poverty indexes were used to examine the data. One-quarter of households income comes from nonfarm activities. The middle-income households had the highest potential to find alternative employment in the nonfarm sector. Years of education, household size, number of family members above the age of 18, and total income had a positive impact on nonfarm revenues. The poorest rural households had the highest share of income from farm activities (77.52%). Nonfarm revenues have a positive impact on poverty alleviation; thus, the study suggests adopting suitable rural policies to enhance nonfarm employment for vulnerable rural households. The agro-tourism sector and circular economy approaches in agriculture with the focus on renewable energy can be considered as potential sources of nonfarm income, which could lead to sustainable poverty reduction.',\n",

              " 'This paper argues that incentives can be a useful tool to bring about change in social policy. These incentives could be linked to the exchange of know-how, share ownership, education, health, and housing. It is a conceptual paper based on secondary data. It suggests radical shifts that marry social policy and matters of corporate governance because education, health, and housing matter to people in as much as profit does to corporates. Government alone cannot solve these wicked problems of poverty, inequality, and unemployment facing contemporary society. This paper applies the Investment Redistributive Incentive Model (IRIM) in South Africa using tourism as an example. IRIM advocates linking foreign and domestic investment to redistribution of the things that matter to people in their different forms - material and non-material to alleviate poverty and inequality. The IRIM should be flexible and amenable to refinements in its application taking cognizance of local circumstances. Linking investments with social policy have the potential to shift policy and practice towards holistic societal transformation through empowering and capacitating communities by increasing their wealth while enhancing social justice and promoting inclusive, sustainable growth.',\n",

              " 'Retirement migration from Germany to Turkey is practiced by both former labour migrants from Turkey who spent their working lives in Germany, and by German retirees without prior migration backgrounds who have discovered Turkey as a retirement destination in the context of tourism. This article presents findings from the empirical investigation of cross-border mobility patterns and motivations among both groups of retirees who are mobile between Germany and popular tourist destinations in the district of Antalya in Turkey. We argue in this article that mobile ageing practices not only exhibit similarities across the two groups, but are also significantly shaped by conditions over which both groups exercise very limited or no control. Economic inequalities, legal insecurities and health imponderabilities emerged as relevant dimensions in our research. Examining how mobile retirees cope with these, we suggest the concept of tactical mobility to make sense of their cross-border migration practices and the reasonings that undergird them.',\n",

By insisting solely on the economic effects of development, tourism has irreversibly degraded and to a certain extent exhausted resources and attractiveness of destinations, thereby leading to their stagnation, and ultimately, to a decline in tourism activities in many destinations. By introducing the concept of sustainable tourism development, tourism analysis extends to other effects that tourism development produces in a given area, primarily the environmental, social and cultural ones. The paper analyses the achieved level of development of tourism in mountain destinations in the Republic of Serbia by using the comparative indicators of sustainable tourism applied in the EU countries. The results of the research indicate that the development of tourism in mountain destinations of the Republic of Serbia does not fully comply with sustainable development. In this respect, the paper provides specific recommendations on how to make tourism sustainable and therefore implement acceptable long-term concept of development of mountain destinations.',\n",
              " 'The management of personal business-to-business (B2B) relationships is an important yet under-researched issue in tourism. Social bonds which develop for a business partner when individuals work together can impact positively on maintaining the relationship with the business partners organization and prevent switching to a competitor. The literature suggests that the management of social bonds is especially significant for small tourism businesses. However there has been limited use of theory to explain what social bonds are and how they can be created. Attachment theory has been used extensively in researching personal relationships but in tourism, its application has been mainly limited to studies on place attachment. This research combines existing knowledge of social bonds and attachment theory to develop a multidimensional social bonds scale which was tested in three separate studies involving tourism and hospitality professionals. The results confirmed the existence of two distinct social bonds: the security bond and the closeness bond, and the scale items provide useful guidance for creating personalized strategies to manage B2B relationships with tourism partners. The new scale is proposed as an important tool to measure the strength of social bonds and recommendations are given on further tourism contexts where the scale could be tested.',\n",

By examining co-creative strategies that promote participative interpretation of archaeological heritage, the emphasis is on understanding how tour guides balance tourists individual interpretations and the scientific narrative. The study conducts a qualitative analysis of the tour guiding activity of cultural tourism companies in Alentejo, Southern Portugal. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with local tour guides and from online reviews of archaeological tours in Alentejo. Findings evidence that despite widely employing co-creative strategies for heritage interpretation that tap into tourists operant resources and encourage creative discussion, tour guides often dismiss individual interpretations in favour of the established authorized heritage discourse. It is argued that, in doing so, the potential of co-creation for delivering a meaningful experience is hindered. The study contributes towards a critical conceptualization of the use of co-creation strategies in heritage tourism, with particular focus on the implications at deeper meaning-making levels. In practice, the findings can lead cultural tourism providers to reassess their approach to personalization in order to increase their appeal to potential clients holding alternative sets of beliefs and motivations.',\n",

But what if that memory already has its onset during the experience itself? In this article, we introduce the concept of anticipatory nostalgia and define it as a moment immediately after a peak moment in the experience, which entails the creation of a mental image of a future moment in time that is accompanied by an emotional response. We present a theoretical model to explicate a process in which anticipatory nostalgia can enhance the meaningfulness and memorability of an experience. We reason that anticipatory nostalgia is characterized by a joyous feeling yet followed by the elicitation of sad emotions. This implies that the tourist already begins to miss aspects of the experience before it is over. This moment results in a reflection which might replace the joy-sadness connection with a joy-calmness connection. Thereby, placing more emphasis on the uniqueness of the total experience.

This could lead to the certification of a large proportion of the population millions worldwide-As not representing a risk of infection to others. It can justify the implementation of a system that can speed up the reactivation of several economic sectors and industries, protecting jobs and accelerating economic recovery in many countries. People who have been ill with Covid-19 have acquired the corresponding antibodies and, therefore, have immunity to the disease, they could travel freely, thereby helping to reactivate the economy. We will explain in this paper how a number of high-Tech tools can be implemented as a crowd control system to identify those who do not represent a risk to others, either because they have acquired immunity or because they can be regarded as not carriers of a communicable disease. We devise a method based on the use of a 3D-diagram that shows the existence of an inverse relation between the number of tests performed and the number of individuals that have contracted the disease.

              " 'Purpose: One of the main factors that can impact the cost of holidays to a particular destination is the exchange rate; exchange rate fluctuations impact the overall price of the holiday and should be expected to effect tourism demand. This paper aims to scrutinize the volatility of the real effective exchange rate between the source market relative to the holiday destination and tourism demand volatility, where the influence of disaggregated data is noted. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses multivariate conditional volatility regressions to simulate the time-varying conditional variances of international visitor demand and exchange rates for the relatively mature Caribbean tourist destination of Barbados. Data on the countrys main source markets, the UK, the USA and Canada is used, where the decision to disaggregate the analysis by market allows the authors to contribute to policymaking, particularly the future of tourism marketing. Findings: The volatility models used in the paper suggests that shocks to total arrivals, as well as the USA and UK markets tend to die out relatively quickly. Asymmetric effects were observed for total arrivals, mainly due to the combination of the different source markets and potential evidence of Butlers (1980) concept of a tourist areas cycle of growth. The results also highlight the significance of using disaggregated tourism demand models to simulate volatility, as aggregated models do not adequately capture source market specific shocks, due to the potential model misspecification. Exchange rate volatility is postulated to have resulted in the greater utilization of packaged tours in some markets, while the effects of the markets online presence moderates the impact of exchange rate volatility on tourist arrivals. Markets should also explore the potential of attracting higher numbers of older tourist, as this group may have higher disposable incomes, thereby mitigating the influence of exchange rate volatility. Research limitations/implications: Some of the explanatory variables were not available on a high enough frequency and proxies had to be used. However, the approach used was consistent with other papers in the literature. Practical implications: The results from the paper suggest that the effects of exchange rate volatility in key source markets were offset by non-price factors in some markets and the existence of the exchange rate peg in others. In particular, the online presence of the destination was one of those non-price factors highlighted as being important. Originality/value: In most theoretical models of tourism demand, disaggregation is not normally considered a significant aspect of the model. This paper contributes to the literature by investigating the impact real effective exchange rate volatility has on tourism demand at a disaggregated source country level. The approach highlights the importance of modeling tourism demand at a disaggregated level and provides important perspective from a mature small island destination.',\n",
              " 'Tourism is a valuable income source for any country. Having a competitive price is crucial for surviving the current environment. This study is on forecasting better prices for a railway tourism company in Europe, considering the past sales patterns with external factors. Currently, they are deciding prices manually rather than using a scientific method. But manual price allocation is not reliable, as it is subjective. To mitigate this issue researchers tried to implement a scientific method for price forecasting. In this study, the performance of Deep Neural Network (DNN), Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) Model, SARIMAX Model, Support Vector Machine, and Extreme Learning Machine was evaluated; which were used by past researchers for price prediction. The acquired dataset contained 89 trip packages and the DNN had the least root mean square error for 75 packages and OLS MLR was the best for the other 14; 11 and 3 using statsmodels and sklearn libraries respectively. As a single model could not be selected as the best model, a hybrid model was created. The hybrid model contained a DNN, an OLS MLR model, a Linear Interpolation function, and a revenue-maximizing function. The theoretically estimated increase in revenue for the hybrid model had a maximum, minimum, and average of 120.59%, 12.12%, and 79.25% respectively. It was concluded that the DNN and OLS MLR models perform best when predicting prices while linear interpolation performs best for interpolating trip prices.',\n",

              " 'Accessibility constitutes one important consideration in the field of scholarship relating to inclusive tourism development because it is fundamentally about the inclusion of people with disabilities in tourism and in society. This conceptual paper maps how accessible tourism is currently positioned against an established framework of inclusive tourism development and gives examples of relevant accessible tourism studies to recommend a future agenda for more inclusive outcomes that move towards sustainability. The seven elements of Scheyvens and Biddulphs (2018) conceptual framework for inclusive tourism development form an appropriate and useful tool upon which to examine the current state of accessible tourism. The application of this framework reveals that we still have some way to go. We conclude this paper with a future agenda that posits attention to all seven elements of the inclusive tourism framework for accessible tourism, notably, to increase the involvement of people with disabilities as tourism producers and consumers; increase their self-representation and participation in decision-making; transform power relations; reimagine tourism places and people; and break down social barriers. We especially urge researchers to examine the dominant ableist discourse, to consider how our inquiry can be more participatory and inclusive, and to seek to bridge inquiry, industry and community.',\n",

The paper aims to analyze how rural residents perceptions of sustainable tourism development (expressed through economic, social, environmental, and physical benefits) can affect residents intentions to support tourism. The second aim was to determine if attachment to the particular community and perceived quality of life can have influence on attitudes towards sustainable development of tourism in rural communities. Using a sample of 881 residents living in rural areas of the Republic of Serbia, the results highlighted that perceived values of tourism were important for evaluating how tourism is developed, if it is sustainable for a community, and how it affects quality of residents life. The study provided better understanding of factors that can have impact on residents attitudes in relation to tourism and highlighted the importance of paying attention to local community as significant player for tourism development, especially in those regions that want to boost its economy by developing sustainable tourism.',\n",

              " 'It is difficult to identify, but there is a type of harassment grounded in gender stereotyping in the context of tourism. It would be useful to discover the hidden relationships between gender harassment and certain beliefs about women as travellers, tourism professionals and sex objects in the field of hospitality. Methodologically, a survey was carried out reaching a sample of 684 units by means of a convenience sampling procedure. The measuring instruments consisted of a structured questionnaire divided into two kinds of Likert beliefs scales comprising general statements and statements related to tourism. The survey respondent data were also gathered as regards sociodemographic characteristics. This paper presents empirical evidence to identify the causal factors of gender violence by considering general and particular stereotyping in tourism. Firstly, by performing three exploratory factor analyses, three female stereotyping dimensions were labelled in the field of tourism (occupational sexism, ambivalent sexist discrimination, and sex as a commodity), as well as three general prejudices about women (dysfunctional romantic relationships, ethically challenged presumptions, and aesthetical manners conventions) and the gender harassment factor. Secondly, a linear regression analysis was carried out to demonstrate that both general stereotyping related to a broader life framework and sectorial prejudices in tourism cause gender harassment. Finally, this research proves that general stereotyping determines sectorial prejudices in the field of tourism. The practical implications could be to enhance gender equality and combat gender harassment by revealing unintentional and unobserved prejudices that occur in a general life setting and in the tourism sphere against women as neglected professionals, under the subtle and ambivalent condition of travellers, and even as objects of consumption.',\n",

This study aims to explore issues related to the image of a rural tourism destination, with the focus on the cognitive component. It also aims to analyze three dimensions of the cognitive component: functional, mixed, and psychological. Furthermore, this study gives the answer to the question of which dimension of the cognitive component makes the most significant impact on the general image of a rural tourism destination. The sample comprised 562 respondents. Data analysis included exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate the existence of three dimensions of the cognitive component, and it can be concluded that the psychological dimension of the cognitive component has the most significant impact on the general image of a rural tourism destination.',\n",

The sample comprises 12,864 firm-level observations during the period 20052016. First, we calculate the efficiency index using a non-radial Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Second, we test the association between efficiency index and contextual factors using both Tobit and bootstrapped regression. Another major contribution is the use of a radial DEA model to confirm the results of the study. The current study offers new insights by focusing on an industry with scarce evidence, using radial and non-radial DEA approaches, and examining a wide variety of efficiency drivers. The efficiency results are examined by year, region and tourist destination type (including tourism dimensions such as rural, cultural and wine tourism). This is an important novelty of the study. The main findings reveal that the most efficient tourism destinations correspond to mixed or diversified destinations: those that combine some dimensions such as cultural, rural and wine tourism. The regressions models show that environmental, macroeconomic and business variables are drivers of tourism competitiveness. Taken together, the study goes a step further in the efficiency field.',\n",
              " 'This article proposes a novel management model for cultural, creative, and historic tourism cities. The creation of the model is based on previous literature and in the study of Barrio de las Letras, in Madrid, to identify the key components to successfully develop creative tourism ecosystems. The model integrates the literature on city center management and, unlike previous studies, incorporates missing elements, such as the role of small businesses associations and collaboration networks among diverse stakeholders to develop a culturalhistoric tourism ecosystem. This model represents a proposal that supports the coexistence of the private and public sector and sustainable governance models that integrate the inhabitants of city centers with the economic activity generated by urban tourism. The model was developed by an analysis of secondary sources, interviews with key informants, and questionnaires of entrepreneurs located in a recently invigorated cultural and historic neighborhood. The contribution of knowledge offered by this paper is the proposition of a management model that can aid town centers to create competitive cultural/creative/historic tourism ecosystems while still preserving the sustainability of their social/commercial fabric. Therefore, the collaboration of cultural organizations, hospitality industry and retail can promote cultural, creative, and sustainable management model of historic urban centers.',\n",
              " 'Rural tourism is one of the important ways to achieve rural revitalization and one of the choices for farmers to improve their viability. Therefore, the socio-ecological systems (SES) analysis framework and obstacle factor analysis can provide a new perspective for the evaluation of farmers behavior adaptation processes. In order to test the adaptation mechanisms of farmers lives in rural tourism destinations, we applied this analysis framework to Ying-Tao-Gou Village in China. The study found that the livelihood adaptation strategies of local farmers can be divided into the categories of tourism livelihood, part-time livelihood, worker livelihood, and farming livelihood. The livelihood adaptation of local farmers presented a relatively balanced picture. There were significant differences in the livelihood adaptability of different types of farmers, but tourism farmers had the strongest livelihood adaptability. There were various barriers to the livelihood adaptation of different types of farmers, such as household savings and education level. Finally, to improve the adaptability of farmers livelihoods, amendments can be made in policy formulation, tourism development, and by the farmers themselves. This study is of great significance for the government in formulating policies to improve peoples livelihoods, to stimulate the vitality of rural development, and to accelerate the development of rural revitalization.',\n",
              " 'While a growing body of literature explores tourism impacts in search of sustainable outcomes, research on justice in diverse tourism settings is nascent. Theoretically informed studies drawing from interdisciplinary perspectives are just beginning to emerge to help examine contestations and injustices such as addressed in the case study presented here. The Little Bighorn Battlefield National Monument (or Custers Last Stand as some know it; LBH) is a protected heritage tourism site that commemorates a battle between Native American tribes and the U.S. military in 1876. Indigenous stakeholders have struggled for decades with the National Park Service to overturn a long legacy of misrepresentation and exclusion from the commemoration and development of the site for heritage tourism. Site closures and other effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic present additional challenges for Native American stakeholders like the Crow Tribe. Guided by Nancy Frasers principles of trivalent justice (redistribution, recognition, and representation), this qualitative study traces the conflict over heritage commemoration, and explores the potential for praxis through ethical tourism development and marketing. Frasers trivalent approach to justice demonstrates the importance of interdisciplinary research to examine historically entrenched discrimination, redress injustices, and facilitate healing and well-being of diverse groups at sites like LBH.',\n",

Students undertake courses, internships, or exchange programs at an overseas university for a period of time. Student exchange programs (SEPs) through educational tourism offer exchange students ample learning opportunities from local universities, industries, and other stakeholders. The purpose of this research was to assess the relationships between experiential benefits (including practical business benefits, rural environmental benefits, and personal sociocultural benefits), professional identity, career choice intentions, and support for educational tourism via SEPs. This study surveyed students from Taiwan, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, and others who attended exchange programs in the field of agriculture in Taiwan and other host countries during the last 15 years and are back in their respective countries. Primary data on exchange students were collected using an online questionnaire survey with a sample size of 326 respondents. The results indicated that professional identity has a full intermediating influence on relationships among experiential benefits, career choice intentions, and support for educational tourism via SEPs. The findings are expected to contribute to the understanding of agricultural students SEP behaviors, and to provide suggestions for planning and managing relevant policy to encourage more students to join SEPs overseas.',\n",

Salamanca (Spain) and Coimbra (Portugal) are analyzed and compared based on 8,638 online travel reviews (OTR), from TripAdvisor (20172018). Findings show that WHS reputation does not seem to be relevant to visitors-reviewers. Additionally, keyword extraction reveals that the reviews do not differ from language to language or from city to city, and it was also possible to identify several keywords related to history and heritage; in particular, architectural styles, names of kings, and places. The study identifies topics that could be used by destination management organizations to promote these cities, highlights the advantages of applying a data science approach, and confirms the rich information value of OTRs as a tool to (re)position the destination according to smart tourism design tenets.',\n",

The main aim of this paper is to determine whether there is a relationship between tourism accessibility and the concept of spiritual sustainability. Spiritual sustainability is presented in the paper by analyzing the concept of a sacred place and the connection it may have with tourism development. The authors have attempted to distinguish the elements determining the tourist and religious (spiritual) attractiveness of several pilgrimage sites as destinations for religious tourism, proposing a model for analyzing the connection between the two concepts studied. Two European regions have been comparedPomerania (Poland) and Catalonia (Spain)by analyzing 30 sacred sites (15 per region) using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods. The results show that a lack of accessibility positively affects the spiritual sustainability of the sites.

The researchers aim to gather practical knowledge regarding tourists intentions for such service enhancements, which may drive the sector to adopt a better conclusive growth pattern in post-COVID-19 times. In this study, we attempt to focus on travelers who look for paramount safety with the assurance of empathetic, personalized care in post-COVID-19 times. In the current study, the authors employ structural equation modeling to evaluate the intentions of tourists both structurally and empirically for destination tourism with data collected from tourists with previous exposure to various kinds of these devices. The study shows that humanmachine interactive devices are integrating AI and VR and have a significant effect on overall service quality, leading to tourist satisfaction and loyalty. The use of such social interactive gadgets within tourism and mostly in hospitality services requires an organization to make a commitment to futuristic technologies, along with building value by enriching service quality expectations among fearful tourists. This research shows that tourists mainly focus on the use of such HMI devices from the perspective of technology acceptance factors, qualitative value-enhancing service and trustworthy information-sharing mechanisms. The concept of the tour bubble framework is also discussed in detail. The analysis of this discussion gives us a more profound understanding of the novel opportunities which various administrative agencies may benefit from to position these devices better in smart, sustainable destination tourism strategies for the future so that, collectively, service 5.0 with HMI devices can possibly bring back tourism from being disintegrated. Such service applications are the new social innovations leading to sustainable service and a sophisticated experience for all tourists.',\n",

The authors own research findings are used to verify the objective. The research was conducted in April and May 2020 with the use of a diagnostic survey method and a questionnaire. Five-hundred sixty-four respondents from Poland (Podlaskie, Masovian, and Lesser Poland Voivodeships) and 133 respondents from the US (New York State, New Jersey, and Illinois) took part in the research. It was divided into organizational, social-economic, and sustainable development related factors. The research confirmed, inter alia, a great impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the organization of tourist travels by the respondents in 2020. The issue presented in the article is a new one; it has not yet been a subject matter of research. That is the major reason the authors aimed to conduct it. What is a new methodological element in the article is the organization of some concepts concerning tourism and a presentation of the influence of COVID-19 on tourism. In the authors opinion, the issues presented are new and have a considerable impact on new trends in the development of tourism at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Through a comparative approach, some wineries from the Italian regions of Abruzzo and Tuscany have been surveyed and in-depth-interviews to key local stakeholders have been conducted. The aim of the survey is to investigate the companies perception about wine tourists characteristics and wine route management. Through a multivariate analysis, the reasons behind wineries satisfaction/discontent have been analyzed. The findings identify a close relation between the complexity of the services offered, the companies involvement in the wine routes management and their satisfaction about the results obtained. The more complex the services are, the more satisfied the companies. The comparative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses pointed out by the wineries keepers has allowed some general considerations about the tools to use for the improvement of wine routes management. In a broader sense, the wineries direct involvement both in investment and in governance appears to be key in the success of the routes as a model for local tourism development.',\n",

The aim of this research was to investigate the pro-environmental behaviour of young tourists in hotels versus at home and the main influencing factors of behavioural intention to reuse towels in hotels. The primary data were collected using a survey that was applied to Romanian young people. Eight hypotheses were formulated and tested through paired samples t-tests, a correlation analysis and a hierarchical multiple regression analysis. Our results showed the higher pro-environmental conduct of young guests at home than in hotels, both through their general behaviour regarding the reduction of resource consumption and through their specific behaviour of reusing towels. Our empirical findings also highlighted that tourists behavioural intention to reuse towels was positively influenced by an eco-friendly attitude, pro-environmental past experiences and habits to reuse towels at home. In order to achieve sustainable tourism, hotel management should convince guests to bring their ecological habits with them, and educational institutions should use specific methods of raising awareness among young people about an environmentally friendly attitude.',\n",

Of its varied impacts, sea level rise is critically pressing because of the long relationship between humans and the ocean. Numerous cultural heritage sites lie on the worlds fragile coasts. Identifying cultural heritage sites at risk is an urgent need, but archaeological research programs do not always have the resources available to conduct large-scale cultural heritage vulnerability assessments. Given sea level rise poses myriad pressing issues, entities around the globe are developing sea level rise models for various management purposes (ecology, hydrology, real estate, etc.). These remote sensing-derived sea level rise models can be harnessed by archaeologists to assess cultural heritage site vulnerability. Here, such an analysis is realized for a northwest Atlantic Ocean coastal area experiencing relative sea level rise and with robust cultural heritage, including economically significant maritime heritage tourism. Combining archaeological and historic geospatial databases with LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-derived relative sea level rise models illuminates coastal New Hampshires cultural heritage vulnerability. This is informative for risk monitoring, mitigation, and preservation planning, especially for cultural heritage tourism. The analysis also raises the need for discussions around what kind and whose heritage gets priority in planning for future sea level rise impacts.',\n",

However, to improve their collaborative capabilities for sustainability (CCS), companies in interorganizational networks need methods to assess them. The existing CCS assessment approaches in the literature do not indicate what capabilities should be improved in an individual company to support collaborative strategies. Addressing this gap, the main contribution of this paper is providing a framework to assess CCS in interorganizational networks, providing support for improving firm-level capabilities. To attain this aim, the framework was based on the graph-theoretic approach (GTA), a multi-attribute technique that captures the interrelationships between elements of a system, providing multi-level and overall assessment. We tested the framework in three hotels from a tourism cluster in Brazil, where sustainability has been an unsettling issue. By applying the assessment framework, it was possible to generate a CCS index for each company and, thereby, to compare the results. Findings from the field confirmed the benefits of using the framework and its utility in assessing CCS and setting priorities for improvement.',\n",

Socio-psychological models of human behaviour, such as the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), have been studying this dissonance between intention and behaviour, and allow to recognise latent critical factors. This paper provides a systematic literature review of research publications on the intersection of the topics of human behaviour, heritage, and sustainability. It aims to analyse how the TPB has been used in the field of sustainable conservation of built heritage. The studies are categorised according to the type of heritage, main actors targeted, aims, and methodology. A total of 140 publications were analysed. The results show a recent field of research. In the domain of built heritage conservation, behaviour is commonly addressed as a synonym of performance, targeting the building itself. Most publications relating socio-psychological constructs of behaviour and heritage sustainability can be found in the tourism and hospitality field, focusing on tourists and residents behaviours. The review shows that practitioners are still absent from the literature. However, research addressing other stakeholders shows that the theoretical framework can play an important role in the implementation of sustainable conservation practices in the built heritage.',\n",
              " 'Acceptance of wind energy development is challenged by stakeholders concerns about potential effects on the environment, specifically on wildlife, such as birds, bats, and (for offshore wind) marine animals, and the habitats that support them. Communities near wind energy developments are also concerned with social and economic impacts, as well as impacts on aesthetics, historical sites, and recreation and tourism. Lack of a systematic, widely accepted, and balanced approach for measuring the potential damage to wildlife, habitats, and communities continues to leave wind developers, regulators, and other stakeholders in an uncertain position. This paper explores ecological risk-based management (RBM) in wind energy development for land-based and offshore wind installations. This paper provides a framework for the adaptation of ecosystem-based management to wind energy development and examines that framework through a series of case studies and best management practices for applying risk-based principles to wind energy. Ten case studies indicate that wind farm monitoring is often driven by regulatory requirements that may not be underpinned by scientific questions. While each case applies principles of adaptive management, there is room for improvement in applying scientific principles to the data collection and analysis. Challenges and constraints for wind farm development to meet RBM framework criteria include collecting sufficient baseline and monitoring data year-round, engaging stakeholder facilitators, and bringing together large and diverse scientific teams. The RBM framework approach may provide insights for improved siting and consenting/permitting processes for regulators and their advisors, particularly in those nations where wind energy is still in the early development stages on land or at sea.',\n",
              " 'Sustainable mobility policies may encounter social, economic, and cultural barriers to successful implementation that need to be assessed. In this sense, knowledge of the populations mobility habits and their relationship with transport modes is particularly essential. Along these lines, a study was carried out of the patterns of transport modes chosen concerning various social and territorial variables on the island of Mallorca based on the most recent mobility surveys. The study shows that the choice of mode is influenced by a wide range of factors, such as gender, age group, motive for the trip, occupation, region of residence, duration of the trip, and proximity to Palma, the capital of the island. The results indicate that private vehicles are the most often chosen mode of transport. Private vehicles are mainly used by working men between 30 and 44 years old for journeys between home and work, which do not exceed 30 min and are preferably in areas close to Palma. Sustainable modes are little used, although they are mainly used by women, young people, and retired people for work purposes and for access to educational and health centers. The demand for transport generated by the resident population and tourist activity and the negative externalities generated by mobility in private vehicles are closely related on a municipal level (Pearsons coefficient 0.84, p = 0.00). However, the modal distribution does not seem to be directly related to these factors. Instead, it develops a more conditioned distribution by access to rail transport infrastructures and other geographical factors. In recent years, the Balearic Islands public administration launched the Balearic Islands Sectorial Mobility Plan 20192026, which aims to promote sustainable modes and reduce the use of private vehicles. This plan represents a considerable economic investment, but will also require great institutional coordination and cultural changes in the populations perception of mobility. The study shows that the implementation of sustainable modes on the island requires a global vision of mobility issues that integrates urban planning and tourism planning to make the land-use model more sustainable.',\n",

While research on service robots in tourism is gaining momentum, the economic aspects of robots adoption have been quite neglected. This article critically evaluates the current research on the economic aspects of service robots in tourism and the implications of robots for tourism economics as a field of research in three domains: tourism supply, tourism demand and destination management. In that way, the article delves into the economics of service robots from the perspectives of the tourism companies, the tourists and the destinations as a whole. On the basis of this discussion, the article identifies various research directions and develops specific research questions related to the adoption of robots in tourism that need to be answered by future research in tourism economics.',\n",
              " 'A conceptual paper published twenty years ago concluded that sustainable tourism development is an unviable objective. Specifically, it argued that environmentally sound tourism development (sustainable tourism) is essential; sustainable development through tourism, however, is unachievable. Despite continuing alignment between tourism and sustainable development in both academic and policy circles, not only have the intervening two decades proved this argument in practice to be correct, but also there is little evidence of a more sustainable tourism sector. This paper, therefore, returns to the theoretical relationship between tourism and sustainable development, considering more recent transformations in understandings of the concept of development as well as contemporary approaches to sustainable development. Highlighting the controversy surrounding the continuing adherence to economic growth in development policy in general and tourism development in particular, it discusses sustainable de-growth as an alternative approach to development and, in the context of increasing concerns over climate change, the specific implications for tourism. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

Social tourism has been in existence since the development of modern tourism but remains a niche research area. Partially, this is because social tourism constitutes part of public welfare policy and directed towards supporting participation in tourism activities by people whose financial or other circumstances prevent them from doing so. This literature review takes a conceptual approach to examine the theoretical underpinnings of social tourism. It combines a bibliometric analysis with an analytic review approach that assesses the key themes and evolution of published research articles in the field and develops a tourism as welfare model that identifies directions for the future development of research in this field.',\n",

              " 'The challenging concern regarding how the benefits of inbound tourism can be evenly distributed, especially among urban and rural individuals, has received considerable attention in China. To address this concern, a spatial econometrics approach is used to estimate the spillover effects of inbound tourism on urbanrural income disparity (URID). An empirical analysis using the spatial Durbin model was conducted for 31 Chinese provinces covering the period from 2003 to 2017. Our findings suggest that at the national level, local inbound tourism significantly reduces the local URID, while neighboring inbound tourism significantly increases the local URID. At the regional level, the role of inbound tourism in reducing the local URID is only detected in the western region. The spillover effects of inbound tourism are positive and significant in the eastern/northeastern region but negative in the western region. In general, these findings provide insights into the importance of interregional tourism policies and strategies for inbound tourism development in China.',\n",

In this article, we propose a novel performance-based tourism forecast combination model by applying a multiple-criteria decision-making framework and the stochastic frontier analysis technique to determine combination weights for individual tourism forecast models. Thirteen time-series models are used to generate individual forecast tourism models, and five competing forecast combination models are selected to evaluate the forecast performance. Using the tourism forecast competition data set, we conclude that the proposed combination model significantly and statistically outperforms the five competing combination models in most cases based on multiple performance indicators.

The main purpose of this particular study is how extracurricular student club membership status of tourism students affect their career intentions and post-graduation employability anxiety. It analyzes student club membership status as a moderating variable in building relationships between the career intentions and post-graduation employability anxiety.

For this reason, trends in the health and physical activity of the population should be considered as part of the promotion of healthy lifestyles in the field of tourism. The aim of this study is to support the multidisciplinary development of evidence-based tourism by using the results of long-term monitoring of physical activity (PA) preferences among youth. Furthermore, this study aims to support the continuation of education regarding tourism, behavioral changes in lifestyle, health promotion (including physical activity promotion), physical conditioning, as well as related mental conditioning. An interdisciplinary approach should lead to the adoption of knowledge, habits, and interests that lead to a lifelong readiness to participate in active tourism. The research sample of this 10-year survey consisted of 17,032 Czech and Polish respondents, aged from 12 to 25 years. A questionnaire on physical activity preferences was employed to explore the current status and trends in physical activity preferences and realization. The results show the actual status and trends in preferred and realized types of physical activity and represent an important indicator of tourism service choices for these youths, as well as predict future interests for tourism clients in schools. The analysis of the results enabled the suggestion of a prognostic model of tourism strategy focused on the integration of physical activity with tourism activities.',\n",

German wine regions have a long history of production, but the value of these regions as tourism destinations has only recently received recognition. In the last few years, wine tourism has gained increasing importance and is believed to result in sustainable development by creating jobs while at the same time preserving a region's heritage. The aim of this paper is to estimate the economic impact of tourism in German wine regions in order to help stakeholders make the right policy and investment decisions. Therefore, a modified multiplier model was developed that allows for the economic impact of wine tourism to be assessed. By collecting 4,448 questionnaires in all 13 German wine regions, travelers provided information about their travel behavior, expenditures, and socio-demographic characteristics. After conducting segmentation, the economic impact of tourism as well as wine tourism was estimated for each of the wine regions. The results show that tourism in German wine regions has an economic impact of EUR 26.4 billion, providing 384,878 people with their primary income. Due to higher expenditures, wine tourists show a disproportionately high economic impact of EUR 5.0 billion, which makes this niche market generate income for 71,846 people. The right investments in this lucrative market could help balance regional economic disparities and achieve sustainable tourism development in the country.\",\n",
              " 'The term mass tourism can simply be an empirical description of tourism enjoyed by many in modern, industrial societies. However, in context, it often refers to more than this. The mass involves an aggregation of individuals, and involves assumptions and inferences about those individuals and their society. Hence mass tourism is, in an important sense, a social construct. It is therefore surprising that there is little consideration of this aspect of mass tourism and its corollary, the mass tourist in relevant literature. The article develops a provisional periodisation of mass tourism in social thought, linking constructions of the mass to the politics of the day. It has an exploratory character, suggesting themes for contestation and/or further research. It indicates changes in the view of mass tourism, but also important continuities relating to an assumption of a lack of agency on the part of mass tourists.',\n",

This study introduces an actor-network perspective to examine the co-evolution of therapeutic landscapes and health tourism, and its inherent dynamism. We argue that therapeutic landscapes and health tourism are emerging out of an integrated actor-network, and thus are in continuous processes of (re)ordering and co-evolution. We also propose a typology of dynamics for the study of such an actor-network, substantiated with an empirical study of the Bama longevity villages in China, in which four interrelated and cascaded dynamics are closely scrutinized: tourists as part of the therapeutic landscape; tourism's impact on the landscape; the heterogeneous therapeutic perceptions of tourists; and the extension of the therapeutic network by health tourism. This study contributes to the relational thinking of therapeutic landscapes and health tourism, and enriches the understanding of their interlacing dynamics from the vantage point of the tourismscape.\",\n",
              " 'A bulk of literature suggests that geopolitical events such as terrorist attacks dampen tourism demand. However, there is little research on whether this effect helps predict the return of the tourism equity sector. We provide country-level evidence on whether local and global geopolitical risk (GPR) predicts the first and second moments of tourism stocks in emerging economies. This objective was achieved by employing the non-parametric causality-in-quantiles (CiQ) model and a cross-quantilogram (CQ) test, which allowed us to uncover the predictive potential of GPR for the tourism sector equities. Our findings, obtained through the CiQ model, suggest that while both local and global GPRs carry significant potential for predicting the returns and volatility of tourism stocks of most emerging economies under normal market conditions, they seem to play no such role in certain countries. These countries include South Korea, for which only a limited number of tourism stocks trade on the domestic stock market compared to other sectors, and Colombia, for which both the domestic stock market and tourism sectors are at an emerging stage. Further, it turns out that, compared to its local counterpart, global GPR has a more pronounced predictive power for the tourism stocks of emerging economies. Finally, with some exceptions, the results are qualitatively similar, and hence reasonably robust, to those when a directional predictability model is applied. Given that geopolitical shocks are largely unanticipated, our findings underscore the importance of a robust tourism sector that can help the market recover to stability as well as an open economy that allows local investors to diversify country-specific risks in their portfolios. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.',\n",

Framed by sociotechnical transitions theory, we introduce the concept of shadowcasting to show how tourism knowledge disseminated through the media, combined with public comments on its reporting, cast shadows that co-constitute imagined futures. We illustrate shadowcasting through a mixed method approach that demonstrates how media reporting and public comments on a recent paper on autonomous vehicles in tourism emerged and diverged from the original paper. Our findings reveal that issues around sex and terrorism were sensationalised, generating diverse public discourses that challenge linear visions of future transport efficiency. Our concluding discussion indicates other tourism research contexts that are most inclined to shadowcasting.',\n",

Using a discrete-time hazards model, we show that tourism-related firms exhibit lower survival rates during times of crisis. We have also found that age, size and legal form increase survival rates. In addition, firms in tourism locations specialized subregions and subregions with higher entry rates have lower chances of survival, whereas firms in tourism destinations with large markets have higher chances to survive.

We find that improved environmental quality, achieved by the restricted allocation of grandfathered permits, leads to tourism-led growth. That is, both the number of tourists and the tourism growth rate increase. By contrast, we find that worsened environmental quality, caused by generous allocation of grandfathered permits and reduced airfares including alien tax, leads to the creation of pollution havens because the policy prompts polluting firms to relocate to the area with the respective regulations. Our findings imply sustainable tourism can be achieved when the respective environmental and tourism policies are implemented.',\n",

Both geographical and sociological methods were used to gather evidence for cultural tourism in that study. Firstly, attractiveness analysis of the area defined for cultural tourism took place. Next, factors influencing the potential for cultural tourism affecting rural development in South Moravia were evaluated. Finally, synergistic relations were discussed. In the territory, many forms of tourism intersect. Based on the results, it can be stated that cultural tourism can hardly be the main driver of rural development after the decline of agriculture because the regions economy has branched out in several directions.

This paper analyses the sustainability of the medical tourism model in Spain in general, and in The Costa del Sol (Spain) in particular, in order to investigate the potential challenges that the domestic industry will face in the future. For this purpose, we first analysed the process of the globalization of health services and the main characteristics of the Spanish medical tourism industry (in terms of tourism and health services). Second, we examined the data availability on medical tourism for the cases of Spain, Andalusia and The Costa del Sol, and identified who travels, why, and for what reasons. The results show that Spain and The Costa del Sol offer high-quality medical and tourism facilities and services with very competitive prices, and with the high commitment and support of public local authorities, tourism and health providers, and universities. However, the lack of a real leadership, well-defined strategy, financial support, and specific training programs are considered to be crucial challenges for the near future.

              " 'This paper examines an indigenous communitys perception of community-based tourism (CBT), using the revised social exchange theory (SET) that recognizes the limits of rationality in explaining behaviour and therefore integrates other exchange rules. Unlike most quantitative SET studies that describe residents perception without explaining the root cause; this qualitative study investigates prior conditioning from socio-cultural background and potential biased information processing as the underlying reasons of residents perception. An indigenous communitys negative perception may be caused by long standing disruption of livelihood from human-wildlife conflict and other non-tourism causes. Livelihood losses aggravate socio-economic deprivations and magnify the expectation for income replacement, such that where tourism income is inadequate, the perceived costs of tourism is amplified. Managing income expectation is therefore crucial in CBT planning. An over-optimistic representation of CBT as a source of livelihood may diminish the role of tourism in conservation conflict management.',\n",

In this scenario, the business of oleotourism, namely, a form of domestic tourism based on activities related to olive oil production, its tasting, and some connected rural experiences such as harvesting, is continuously albeit slowlygrowing in Europe and especially in the Mediterranean area. Scholars agree that oleotourism plays a key role for multiple reasons, due to its relations to local territories, firms, resources, and other forms of tourism, also favoring sustainable development. Due to the interplay with the local context, the authors plan to combine and compare the evidence from three Mediterranean countries offering examples of tourism initiatives based on olive oil, namely, Spain, Italy, and Croatia. The similarities and differences emerging from the comparison will expand the understanding of this phenomenon and lead to the highlighting of key features and choices in favoring its development in the coming years. Therefore, this research, through the analysis of both theoretical and practical evidences and data from the local contexts, aims to identify additional knowledge for scholars, managers, and policy-makers. The results of the analysis allow the authors to conclude that, although each of the three countries is in a different stage of development, they all have elements that seem to be common to this type of tourism. Finally, it is concluded that oleotourism can be characterized as a form of sustainable tourism, given the preservation of local customs and landscapes, the participation of the resident community, or the development of quality and food safety labels.',\n",

In this investigation, a panel bootstrap cointegration test and an augmented mean group (AMG) estimator were applied. The empirical findings indicate that the tourism-induced EKC hypothesis is valid only for France. Additionally, it was detected that a rise in renewable energy consumption has a negative (reduction) impact on CO2 emissions in France, Italy, the UK, and the US. However, an increase in the receipt of international touristm has a positive (additional) impact on Italys CO2 emissions.

              " 'This research explores how tourist site management and human attitudes and behaviours can help decrease the pressure of tourism on the environment. Estimates show that, together with ancillary sectors, the tourism industry is expected to contribute approximately 6.5 gigatons of greenhouse gases by 2025. These emissions are primarily a result of tourists favouring air travel and luxury experiences that require more energy outputs. Additionally, tourism continues to grow and has become a routine activity for the middle class who travel more regularly on an annual basis. With growing middle classes in many developing countries, the number of tourists who will be able to afford recreational travel is estimated to increase exponentially. The pressures and demands of increasing tourist numbers can strain vulnerable natural sites. These predictions show that changes within the tourism industry fabric are necessary. Against this backdrop, this research employs a combined methodology. A survey methodology was employed to explore tourist attitudes towards tourism sites and their behaviours and decision making with a top-down and bottom-up approach. Additionally, an interview methodology of tourism field experts was employed to investigate the attitudes of the industry and how consumer behaviours may be influenced. Findings from the survey and interview discussions were employed to inform four managerial aspects. First, the ticket price of the tourist experience should be proportional to the value proposition of the experience. Second, a government-led framework could guide businesses towards sustainable management and educate their tourists on greener practices. Third, businesses could integrate sustainability issues into their marketing and advertising to create awareness and ensure the longevity of the site. Lastly, tourism bodies and businesses could increase their partnerships with local custodians to add cultural value and understand the visitor experience.',\n",

Our research aims to analyze the opinions and perceptions of SME managers in the field of tourism in terms of the concept of competitiveness, how to measure it and sources of competitiveness still viable within the context of the current crisis or specific to it, etc. In order to be able to properly analyze the above, qualitative research was initiated and conducted in the form of an in-depth interview with 42 Romanian SME managers in the tourism field. The results of the study reflect a mature approach of managers in terms of possible new sources of competitivenessthe emphasis on technical solutions capable of managing the socio-medical dimensions of tourism consumer behavior, a prevalence for an organic growth strategy and for additional investments in qualified personnel, as well as online management of most aspects related to services and openness to collaboration within tourism clusters.',\n",
              " 'In the post-Covid-19 era, tourism impacts and the role played by sustainable planning on the long-term success of destinations have gained renewed importance. Understanding the image and perceptions tourists hold of a destination is vital for tourism planning, as they play a key role in tourists decisions. Considering the importance of these two key concepts (perceptions and sustainability), the present paper contributes to the advancement of knowledge on sustainable tourism by characterizing the state of the art of Sustainability Perceptions in Tourism and Hospitality (SPTH). To this end, the scientific literature on the topic was mapped through a combination of three bibliometric analysis techniques, namely: evaluative, relational, and systematic bibliometric analysis. These were based on productivity and impact indicators, including SciVal topic prominence. The results reveal that sustainability perceptions in SPTH focus on tourists, stakeholders, and residents perceptions. These findings highlight the need for involving local communities in the destination planning process to align the outcomes of tourism development with their expectations. Finally, this paper presents an original methodological contribution, as it is the first to apply the SciVal topic prominence analysis to SPTH.',\n",

The existing research on tourism in Kashmir is centred on tourists and their well-being. Studies on the local communities are almost absent for the region even though it is an indispensable part of sustainable tourism. The present work is an attempt to analyse the factors that determine support for tourism by local residents in the Kashmir region. The primary data has been collected through questionnaire method from local residents of Pahalgam and Gulmarg, two top tourist destinations in the Kashmir region. PLS-SEM is applied for data analysis.

              " 'This manuscript critically assesses the relationship between novelty and memorable tourism experiences (MTEs). Prior literature indicates that novelty is an antecedent of attention, emotions, memory and behaviour. Despite this focus limited studies have considered the emergence of novelty in broader psychological literature. Subsequently, this manuscript explores the evolution of novelty across personality, behavioural, cognitive and neuropsychology. Drawing on a narrative review this manuscript observes that concepts from behavioural and personality psychology have traditionally dominated tourism literature. However, cognitive and neuropsychological approaches are emerging in prevalence, which presents an opportunity to advance discourse on MTEs. A core contribution of this manuscript is a visual representation which depicts the evolution of novelty across four schools of thought in psychology, outlining potential implications for the tourism scholarship. Future research on tourism experiences should consider advances in the parent discipline of psychology.',\n",

Rural tourism as an instrumental tool against poverty requires rural tourism products to be not only viable but also sustainable. Presented is a sustainability assessment framework to assist South African enterprises to assess the sustainability of their rural tourism products (RTPs). The framework has two functions: it provides RTP operators with an understanding of all aspects of sustainability for which they are responsible and it provides indicators to measure the sustainability of the product. The indicators are presented as a sustainability scale that acts like a road map to enable operators to improve the sustainability of their RTPs in successive years. The intention and purpose of the framework is to ensure that sustainability is central to the operation of RTPs in South Africa thereby contributing toward sustainable development goals.',\n",
              " 'Durkheims theory of collective emotion and the concept of perceived emotional synchrony are used to explore tourism memories and to create a conceptual model explaining how and why we come to agree on how we felt when reliving past tourism experiences. This process is dependent on the malleability of memory, which allows emotional synchrony to happen in retrospect, regardless of actual feelings at the time. I argue that the innate motivations behind this post-consumption merging are a stronger sense of community and of belonging to a social group. For tourism practitioners, this highlights where the true value lies for the consumer, the belief in a shared emotional experience. This value develops through the synchronization of memories creating the basis for a shared memory economy. The implications for tourism marketers are discussed, and suggestions for further research into memory and travel experience are identified.',\n",

In tourism development, visitors and local residents have reached a common cognitive basis for Kunqu Opera through cultural identity, thereby guiding consumer behavior and promoting the continuous development of Kunqu Opera tourism. This study takes Suzhou Kunqu Opera as a research object, designs a questionnaire for local residents and tourists, establishes a structural equation model, and explores the relationship between various impact factors. The results of the study show that cultural identity has a positive effect on consumption intentions in heritage tourism activities, confirming that cultural identity is an effective driving force to promote tourists consumption intention. Behavioral attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control have a positive effect on consumption intentions.

              " 'The current study explored the triadic relationship between the government, local residents and developers as stakeholders in rural tourism land expropriation. Unstructured interviews and non-participant observation were conducted to obtain relevant data. Social action theory was applied to delineate the complex interaction and relationships between the various stakeholders. Growth machine theory was also used to reveal the internal mechanisms of these relationships. The results showed that in land expropriation for rural tourism development in the case setting, stakeholders relationships were not merely cooperative or antagonistic; rather, their interests were interwoven and showed a process-based evolution with the progress of land expropriation. Finally, the local government (political elite) and the developer (economic elite) formed a growth coalition and jointly led the process of land expropriation. However, local residents failed to form an anti-growth coalition, which indicates the potential vulnerability of tourism coalition formation. These insights have implications for developing sustainable tourism, including government involvement and resident participation, particularly in the context of developing countries. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

This research incorporated the anticipated emotion into the original model of norm activation theory (NAT) to explain the environmentally responsible behavior in heritage tourism. The results show that the proposed model has greater prediction power than the original NAT. Both positive and negative anticipated emotion form significant relationships with the constructs in the extended model of NAT and play partial mediating roles. The significant relationship among constructs in the original NAT was revealed in a heritage tourism context. This study contributes to the literature in heritage tourism.',\n",

              " 'Linking food producers and tourism for the benefit of local communities in developing countries has been on the research agenda since the early 1980s. Scholars have elaborated on why linkages rarely fully materialise and they have identified a multitude of factors. Despite local food enthusiasm amongst consumers, little has changed in how the tourism industry in developing countries procures food. Mostly, these linkages have been analysed from the common demand-and-supply standpoint. While this approach is valuable for investigating food chains in general, the concept of cuisine is proposed as a more holistic alternative that embeds an economic viewpoint into the cultural context. If tourism is to be used as a mechanism for sustainable development, then tools of analysis need to be chosen accordingly. Rather than relying solely on economic logic, we propose to also examine broader cultural and social factors through the lens of cuisine. This puts kitchen chefs, and possibly other hotel managers, who negotiate the space between guests expectations, food supply and cultural heritage, at the centre of attention. Based on ethnographic field research by the first author, a case study of tourism-agriculture linkages in Fiji illustrates the value of the concept of cuisine.',\n",

The conservation and restoration of heritage, and its promotion through tourism, can become an opportunity for local development, in which a range of stakeholders fulfil different roles in the carrying out of the processes involved. The aim of the study was to analyse the heritagisation processes and their tourist value enhancement and how it affects local development in Mrtola (Baixo Alentejo, Portugal). A series of interviews with the chief stakeholders in the process were conducted, from which the contexts and conceptualisations of development were determined. On the basis of secondary data in terms of statistics, an analysis of the impacts of the process of heritagisation and the development of tourism was undertaken. The main conclusions drawn by the research are the following: (a) the importance of the process of heritagisation in Mrtola; (b) the viability of the project, given the cost and lack of comprehensive conservation, in creating a unified whole; (c) the performance of, and power relationships between, the various stakeholders; (d) the limited participation of locals due to disaffection with the project; (e) the correlation between heritage, rural tourism, and local development.',\n",

Although international media paid significant attention to overtourism contributing to raising concerns for local tourism impacts, limited efforts were made to explore the medias representation of the phenomenon and its role in shaping the understanding of overtourism in public opinion and amongst policymakers. This paper contributes to the academic debate on overtourism by adopting a narrative approach to the analysis of how online news media represented it, stated its causes and effects, and suggested the actions to be taken for addressing it. The research provides novel interpretative perspectives on urban overtourism. It identifies the coexistence of factual, behavioural and perceptual overtourism effects and the role of passive and active urban stakeholders in overtouristified cities, suggesting further research on the local origin of the phenomenon. A set of managerial tools, including smart technologies, sheds light on the approaches to addressing overtourism in the city, suggesting the importance of transcending conservative managerial views and moving towards inclusive and sustainable tourism development.

Furthermore it proposes an analytical framework for in-depth research on concrete cases. The study contributes to the emerging discussion on the tension between safeguarding and commodifying ICH by an interdisciplinary literature review and interviews with key stakeholders in Austria. The study analyses experts opinions and presents some domains of local or traditional nature-related knowledge from Austria, considered as ICH and valorised through tourism and leisure offers. The commercial use of this knowledge and the simultaneous effort to safeguard it as ICH bring numerous actors from tourism and heritage organisations and their interests into conflict. UNESCOs influence in heritage-making and valorisation and the prioritising of certain domains and thus increasing their chance for tourism utilisation are also discussed. Furthermore, findings from the expert interviews reveal that the concepts traditional or local are problematic in the European context because the boundaries between localities, as well as between experience-based and scientific knowledge are unclear.

              " \"This paper examines how governance arrangements for marine conservation tourism in the new regency of Raja Ampat, Indonesia, have evolved as a result of Indonesia's decentralization policy and what role NGOs have played in this process. The analysis shows that over a period of two decades NGOs have played a major co-governance role by informing and mobilizing local communities, by establishing and managing marine protected areas, as well as by supporting the technical and financial capacity of the newly established regional government of Raja Ampat. Over time a patchwork of non-state governance and open co-governance arrangements in marine conservation tourism transformed into more integrated closed co-governance arrangements, in which state authority became more important.

It also investigates the tourist needs of the Algerian population after the closure of international borders. Methods: The data were collected using a mixture of quantitative and qualitative methods through a questionnaire applied to 203 people in different regions of Algeria (a North African country) from 1st June to 13 July 2020. Results: The needs of Algerian tourists were characterized by a great need for leisure to relieve psychological stress caused by COVID-19 (M = 25.33) among the study sample (p < 0.05). The results also show an average need to rationalize the costs of tourist services (M = 5.26) according to the respondents (p < 0.01). This is in addition to the great need (M = 7.75) among respondents (p < 0.05) of the awareness that the tourism sector can contribute to the economic recovery in Algeria after the confinement period. About 75.86% of respondents requested the cleanliness of tourist sites, while 69.95% recommended improving safety because of the size of tourist sites in the Algerian territory as well as measures related to social distancing. The results show that 53.69% of respondents preferred the month of August to go on vacation, 29.06% chose the month of September, and 17.25% would prefer the months of October, November, and December since they expected a reduction in the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the tourism needs of the Algerian population, which has become increasingly aware of the consequences of the pandemic in relation to their health and in relation to the countrys economy. These results can help the authorities of the tourism sector to better understand and identify the tourism needs of this population in the current period and after the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

The paper addresses this gap by way of a nuanced analysis of mixed-methods research undertaken on behalf of Northumberland County Council (NCC), UK, on the impacts of onshore-windfarms on tourism in Northumberlands rural hinterland. We also trace the influence the research has had on NCCs policy and land-use decision-making practices in the years since the research was completed in 2014, with particular focus on national policy changes enacted in 2016 that gave local communities more decision-making power on the siting of onshore-windfarms across the UK.

Drawing on Ingolds (2000. The perception of the environment: Essays on livelihood, dwelling and skill.

Focussing on the Yesanpo Scenic Area with more than 4.5 million visitors each year and annual tourism revenue of 150 million yuan, flood risk modelling was undertaken using HEC-HMS and FlO-2D. Three flood scenarios (a real event that occurred in 2012, a hypothetical flood in 2017, and a future flood scenario) were evaluated using remote sensing and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools. The results show that from 2012 to 2017, due to the development of tourism and changes in land-use in the area, the flash flood risk increased by 28%. During this six-year period, most of the agricultural land surrounding the Juma River has been changed to tourist use and the land value has increased by 38%. Based on an inundation depth of 0.5 m, land value losses are expected in the order of 104 yuan m2 for business use land and 0.8 yuan m2 for agricultural land. Relative to the baseline flood scenario, the flood risk in three studied villages is expected to increase significantly by 103% under the modelled future scenario. Even where disasters have been experienced, risks are often ignored in tourist areas because tourism in these areas can generate high revenue. Our findings provide important new information for tourism planners facing the long-term effects of flash floods. Sustainable planning decisions and flood control measures are required in these mountainous areas that do not affect the amenity value of the natural landscape.',\n",
              " 'Governments are increasingly adopting Blue Growth strategies as a means of promoting economic development. Although Blue Growth offers development opportunities, from a local perspective it is often concentrated in inaccessible sectors or has negative impacts on coastal communities and landscapes. We argue that to be of use to local communities, tourist experiences of coastal landscapes need to be understood from a community-led, rather than market-led, perspective. Tourist market segmentation can help reveal such experiences but has predominately been used in a narrow, econometric way by the tourism industry, market researchers and policymakers. These approaches often fail to capture the innate experiential nature of coastal tourism and often result in the production of coastal tourism that is unsympathetic to community landscape perspectives and values. To address this gap, this paper adopts an experiential tourist segmentation approach based on community experiences of coastal landscapes. Applied to data collected from a tourist survey on the west coast of Ireland, we identify five landscape experiences: well-being experiences; conscientious travel experiences; nature experiences; coastal change experiences; and cultural experiences. Based on these experiences, four alternative tourist segments were identified, with significant alignment to communities around sustainable, ethical and locally sensitised forms of tourism, as follows: Blue Health Seekers; Nature Escapers; Pristine Seekers; and Heritage Explorers. The paper concludes by arguing that adopting more experiential and dialogical approaches to market segmentation will identify tourist and communities perspectives in ways that are compatible and will reveal opportunities for more inclusive and locally accessible forms of Blue Growth.',\n",
              " 'In a context of global-scale inequalities and increased middle-class transnational mobility, this paper explores how the arrival of Western European and North American migrants in Barcelona drives a process of gentrification that coexists and overlaps with the development of tourism in the city. Research has focused increasingly on the role of visitors and Airbnb in driving gentrification. However, our aim is to add another layer to the complexity of neighbourhood change in tourist cities by considering the role of migrants from advanced economies as gentrifiers in these neighbourhoods. We combined socio-demographic analysis with in-depth interviews and, from this, we found that: (1) lifestyle opportunities, rather than work, explain why transnational migrants are attracted to Barcelona, resulting in privileged consumers of housing that then displace long-term residents; (2) migrants have become spatially concentrated in tourist enclaves and interact predominantly with other transnational mobile populations; (3) the result is that centrally located neighbourhoods are appropriated by foreigners  both visitors and migrants  who are better positioned in the unequal division of labour, causing locals to feel increasingly excluded from the place. We illustrate that tourism and transnational gentrification spatially coexist and, accordingly, we provide an analysis that integrates both processes to understand how neighbourhood change occurs in areas impacted by tourism. By doing so, the paper offers a fresh reading of how gentrification takes place in a Southern European destination and, furthermore, it provides new insights into the conceptualisation of tourism and lifestyle migration as drivers of gentrification.',\n",
              " 'Increased international tourism in large European cities has been a growing social and political issue over the last few years. As the number of urban tourists has rapidly grown, studies have often focused on its socio-spatial consequences, commonly referred to as touristification, and have linked this to gentrification. This connection makes sense within the framework of planetary gentrification theories because the social injustices it generates in cities have a global pattern. However, gentrification is a complex process that must be analytically differentiated from tourism strategies and their effects. Whereas gentrification means a lower income population replaced by one of a higher status, touristification consists of an increase in tourist activity that generally implies the loss of residents. Strategies to appropriate and marketise culture to sustain tourism-led economies can also shape more attractive places for foreign wealthy newcomers, whose arrival has been theorised as transnational gentrification. Discussions on the relationship between gentrification, transnational gentrification and touristification are essential, especially regarding how they work in transforming an urban areas social fabric, for which Seville, Spains fourth largest city with an economy specialised in cultural tourism, provides a starting point. The focus is set on the processes timelines and similar patterns, which are tested on three consecutive scales of analysis: the city, the historic district and the Alameda neighbourhood.

              " 'For tourism to be entirely sustainable, one cannot travel. This is impossible. This paradox is particularly evident within last chance tourism (LCT), where tourists, seeking experiences with vanishing animals and land/seascapes, can accelerate the decline of those very attractions. Though recent studies hint that those with the highest intentions to visit LCT destinations are also some of the most concerned with climate change, no study has assessed the psychological drivers that may help explain why individuals are increasingly engaging in this paradox. Drawing on the VBN model, this research examines a theoretical framework to assess the psychological drivers behind individuals intention to engage in environmentally responsible behavior while traveling and, ultimately, their desire to participate in LCT. Results reveal that a set of environmentally referent cognitions (i.e., values, environmental worldview, awareness of consequences, and ascription of responsibility) lead to personal norms activation, which then influence tourists intent to behave in pro-sustainable ways and, ultimately, individuals intentions to engage in LCT. Findings are important as they further confirm the benefits of using VBN theory within an LCT context. For practitioners, this research strengthens the appeal of sustainable tourism operations to secure business and receive positive word-of-mouth from potential LCT tourists. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
              " 'The Kingdom of Tonga is a one of the few countries worldwide that allow swim-with-whales tourism activities. Most of the tour operators are based in Vavau archipelago which represents an important breeding ground for Oceania humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae). This study represents an assessment of the effects of swimmer approaches on humpback whales behaviour using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). UAV flights took place during the 2016 and 2017 whale breeding seasons from onboard research and swim-with-whales vessels. Whales behavioural states (resting, travelling, surface-active, socialising, nurturing) were assessed from aerial videos and the proportions of time spent in each state in the presence and absence of swimmers were compared. Whale agonistic behaviours directed towards swimmers and the injury of a swimmer caused by a whale were documented. Results indicate that in-water tourism activities significantly altered the time spent in each behavioural state by humpback whale in Vavau. Mother-calf pairs decreased the proportion of time spent nurturing, while the time spent travelling increased two-fold when approached by swimmers. These findings indicate a potential energy expenditure increase for humpback whale mothers and their calves in response to swim-with tourism activities in Vavau. Moreover, whales behavioural responses can pose danger of injury to swimmers. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

              " \"Providing accurate and timely hazard warnings to residents in Iceland is a difficult task despite authorities being familiar with the at-risk population. A more challenging task is communicating that same information with a transient population i.e., the increasing number of tourists who visit Iceland and engage in activities on and around Iceland's volcanoes. Increased tourism results in greater numbers of tourists exposed to potentially harmful and life-threatening situations. To enhance awareness of these potential situations, authorities rely on risk communication initiatives. This paper examines people's perceptions and beliefs with respect to risk communication initiatives and, behaviour in volcanic environments. Data informing this research was captured through focus group discussions, interviews and questionnaire surveys in a longitudinal study conducted from 2009 to 2017 and involved a range of stakeholders: tourists, tour guides and operators, local police, government officials, rescue team members, local residents and, disaster risk reduction academics, practitioners and professionals. The aims of interrogating these datasets are to: 1) identify whether risk communication initiatives are enhancing or have the potential to enhance tourists' safety and 2) provide evidence-based recommendations to inform the continual improvement of risk communication strategies within the tourism sector. This work is critical given the economic significance of tourism in Iceland and the frequency of volcanic eruptions and other natural hazard events. The results suggest that while these initiatives are reaching some people, they are not accessible to the majority and are therefore ineffective, in their current form, at enhancing tourists' safety. The results also show that tourists are generally not risk averse, highlighting the considerable challenges communicators face. In light of these challenges, we must continually strive to ensure that tourists are well equipped to make informed decisions to prevent injury and fatality. It is imperative that the sector as a whole is actively involved in risk reduction strategies. This includes long-term and ongoing commitment to regularly distributing consistent hazard, risk and response information through all available channels so that when a warning is issued it does not come as a surprise; and, ensuring risk communication information and tools meet the needs of the intended audience. The importance of this research extends beyond Iceland's volcanic environment, given the occurence of death and injury associated with nature-based tourism worldwide. To enhance tourists' safety, governments and the tourism sector as a whole, must invest greater resources and commitment to ensure tourists have access to accurate and up-to-date information so they can make informed decisions about their travel choices.\",\n",

This pioneer study aims at explaining tourist inspiration from the drivers and moderators perspective. Specifically, place attachment and openness to experience are hypothesized as drivers of tourist inspiration while service value to peaceful life and service value to social recognition are investigated as moderators. To test the proposed hypotheses, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) is applied to a sample of 238 international tourists from Europe, America and Asia travelling to Vietnam. The results indicate that both place attachment and openness to experience have positive effects on tourist inspiration. In addition, service value to peaceful life is found to weaken the relationship between openness to experience and inspiration.

The sources of this practical knowledge are especially high-ranking masters. The scientific problem raised here involves the issue of high-ranking martial arts teachers taking trips for their own studies (to acquire knowledge and skills) and teaching others. Some of the questions addressed include how often the trips occur (single, sporadic, or multiple, regular), what their effects are, and what their meaning isin the opinion of these experts. The Martial Arts Tourism questionnaire was addressed to N = 12 people, masters/teachers of high-rank in martial arts (level 710 dan/toan) who live and teach in Europe and the USA, but come from Europe. They are the holders of the highest degrees in Chinese, Japanese and Korean styles. Further questions were asked through direct correspondence. The collected statements were usedby means of qualitative analysisas in the method of expert courts/competent judges. The respondents in most cases undertook trips from Europe to East Asia for their own learning. They teach themselves mainly in their own countries and in Europe. Stays rarely lasted over two weeks. The respondents are convinced of the legitimacy of this type of trip, and believe that the trips are very helpful on the way to mastery. None of the respondents mentioned the material forms of cultural heritage pertaining to martial arts as motives for the trips. Therefore, the ability to visit historic places is a marginal concern. The trips were directly linked to a career path and self-improvement in martial arts, learning or teaching.',\n",

              " 'Since the theoretical lens of lifestyle mobilities was introduced, there has been a growing interest in the role of mobility in weakening rigid binaries such as home/away and work/leisure. This article draws on this theoretical perspective to explore how sojourners in Macau blur spatial and temporal binaries in their adaptation to their new and temporary situation. Individual thematic interviews with 17 sojourners were conducted, revealing their choice of lifestyle as regards home/away and work/leisure patterns. Theoretically, the study demonstrates how once distinct spheres of social life such as home, away, work, and leisure are now highly integrated. Sojourners keep a sense of being at home through upholding their habitual routine; simultaneously, they feel away from home by partly adopting a local lifestyle and exploiting the sightseeing and tourism opportunities. Yet long working hours can highly restrict leisure and in particular tourism activities. Empirically, this study documents different types of lifestyles among Macau sojourners ranging from selective mobilisation of the local resources into a lifestyle attuned to their new temporary circumstances to almost exclusive concentration on work and cultural indifference to the new environment and the opportunities it offers.',\n",

Their results resolve a longstanding paradox in tourism ecocertification, whereby programs persist despite low take-up amongst potential members. The mechanism is that programs start by signing up high-performing enterprises, creating an attractive club, but to sign up additional members they then lower entry standards, opening membership to poorly performing enterprises. This makes the certification club less exclusive, and dilutes benefits. In addition, if only few tourist clients rely on ecocertificates, it creates intra-club rivalry for benefits. Therefore, early-joining, high-performing members leave, creating member turnover and keeping overall take-up low. This is an example of a Goldilocks effect, a couplet of mechanisms that jointly prevent a parameter taking very large or very small values, or render the parameter observable only within a certain range. This effect applies only for private third-party ecocertification programs that rely on member fees to remain in business. It may not apply to programs operated by government agencies, or by private entities with government monopolies. It applies for ecocertification, where financial rewards of membership are limited; but not necessarily for luxury labels, which can sustain high price premiums. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

The research has an exploratory nature as it involves the design and pilot test of an application based on gamification known as HEgameApp in an undergraduate program in tourism in the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Spain). This research study analyses whether students' intention to use this gamified app is determined by their perception of expected benefits (functional, hedonic and social), by the costs associated with the use of the application (loss of privacy and difficulty of use) or by their personal characteristics (attitude towards learning, attitude towards innovation and demographic profile). The results show that expected hedonic and social benefits influence a student's intention to use HEgameApp. Our findings also evidence that students' attitude towards learning as well as to innovation has a positive and significant role in a student's intention to use a gamified app. Finally, the results show that the loss of privacy exerts a moderator effect on the relationship between the intention to use the gamified app HEgameApp and expected functional benefits. Therefore, the empirical results demonstrate that educational community could do a great deal to enhance a student's intention to use gamification strategies leading to the greater application of innovative technological, educational tools in tourism face-to-face learning.\",\n",

Certain roads in protected areas or near tourist attractions are experiencing an increase in traffic volumes, leading to higher pollution and noise levels and greater discomfort in the travel experience. To recommend measures intended to ensure a sustainable tourism industry without compromising the environment, it is necessary to obtain further knowledge regarding tourists' travel behaviour as it may differ from that of other travellers, i.e., tourists might choose a route based on variables other than time and cost, such as landscape or tourist attractions. Using Geiranger Fjord in Norway as a case study, tourist route choice preferences were observed and analysed. In total, 60 routes from 12 different origins were observed based on 408 responses collected through a tourist survey administered in the summer of 2018. These data were combined with information regarding road features and the locations of tourist attractions. A path size correction logit model was selected to estimate the significant variables in the choice of one route over other routes. The results showed that tourists selected their routes mainly based on the travel time, road scenery (water bodies and forests), sightseeing places among first-time visitors, and outdoor activities among those living outside of Norway. In addition, the tourists preferred local roads, and 'caravan' tourists were more attracted to roads with fewer facilities. The findings of this study show that tourists route choice behaviour differs from that of other travellers. Policymakers should consider these differences to enhance transport systems. Further research should focus on incorporating these findings into a transport model to simulate tourists' travel patterns and quantify changes in traffic volumes due to different sustainable measures.\",\n",

For many decades, San Marcos was relatively isolated from other nearby communities and many speakers were monolingual in Kaqchikel. However, recent changes in the community, particularly a rise in tourism and access to education, have contributed to an increased need for Spanish. The present study draws from qualitative data collected from sociolinguistic interviews and participant observation to determine both the usage of Kaqchikel and Spanish in the community and the attitudes that bilingual speakers have toward both languages.

Two experimental studies confirm that when consumers learn of unfavorable conditions in a destination (e.g., snow deficiency) through online content, they develop more realistic travel expectations and ultimately more positive attitudes toward the destination, compared with when they review online content that ignores the unfavorable conditions. In addition, user-generated content influences the mediating effect of realistic expectations on the relationship between climate-induced, unfavorable conditions at a destination and attitudes toward the destination, whereas DMO-generated content does not. Implications underline the importance of realistic destination marketing communication strategies.

Based on three rural case studies, this research investigates within-destination travel patterns, focusing on the relationship between accommodation hubs and attractions as represented by visitor flows. The graphical representation of flows enables, firstly, the identification of influence areas of attractions which traverse administrative boundaries and overlap with those of other attractions, and secondly, the factors affecting the influence areas of attractions.

It accomplishes three objectives: (1) to estimate the economic contribution of domestic and inbound visitor expenditure; (2) to measure the economic contribution of tourist spending at various accommodation classes; and (3) to describe the use of local commodities and labor in the regional accommodation industry. To accomplish the first and second objectives, an input-output multiplier analysis was employed. As for the third objective, interviews were conducted with 35 representatives from regional accommodation establishments. Tourism is found to contribute greatly to the regional economy, as shown from the higher overall output multiplier for tourist expenditure as compared to the regional output multiplier. The output multiplier for inbound tourist expenditure is higher than the domestic tourist. Three-star accommodations are found to be the biggest contributor with outstanding inter-sectoral impact on fisheries; food, beverage, and tobacco manufacture; and agriculture.

However, most of the literature has followed a supply-based perspective, ignoring the way that tourists view sustainability attributes. Therefore, this research attempts to address this gap in the literature by analyzing tourists perceptions concerning sustainability attributes in tourist destinations. This research aims to determine which of these traits are seen as most important by the tourists and to ascertain their willingness to pay for these aspects. The study is quantitative, based on an online questionnaire administered to Turkish cultural tourists. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used to obtain insights into how tourists consider sustainability aspects in tourist destinations. Thus, this research concludes that tourists view sustainability from a more varied perspective than that embraced by the classic definition of the concept, which comprises economic, environmental and socio-cultural dimensions. The findings of the study also determine that tourists favor sustainability attributes that are instrumental in enhancing their own tourist experiences. This information may be useful for destinations, providing guidance about how to market sustainable tourist destinations and encourage responsible tourism choices.',\n",
              " 'This note presents three important facts on the COVID-19 pandemic and 22 developing countries, namely those in the Pacific. First, social protection systems are less common in the Pacific than in the rest of the world, meaning the region is not particularly well equipped to deal with the sharp decline in economic activity associated with the disease and standard policy responses (e.g., lockdowns) without plunging a large share of the population into poverty. Second, aggressive travel restrictions and effective domestic policy responses have spared many Pacific countries from the worst impacts of COVID-19. Ten countries have not had a single confirmed case. The experience of the region thus offers helpful lessons for other developing countries in keeping the crisis at bay. Third, the relative success of Australia and New Zealand in managing the virus provides an opportunity to pilot and test in the region what a carefully managed pathway to allow the tourism, migration, and remittances, that many countries depend on, to begin flowing again.

The accommodation sector is an important area of action, yet taxonomies and empirical investigations of environmental management practices (EMPs) have not been tailored to the context of World Heritage Sites (WHSs). This study fills this gap by proposing a new taxonomy and framework featuring items of tangible and intangible heritage. Twenty-five interviews and a survey of 124 hotels across two sites were employed to examine EMPs and their determinants and to explore possible synergies between environmental performance and heritage. Results show that budget hotels, which use significantly less EMPs, prevail within both heritage sites boundaries. Guesthouses and boutique hotels, however, adopt a range of EMPs that blends technology and traditional knowledge and they are more likely to try to engage customers. The determinants for adoption are often individual values or exchanges of information with actors that include traditional heritage businesses. Customers instead exert a negative influence over the adoption of EMPs. The study advances the conceptualization of EMPs and their adoption in WHSs and provides insights for heritage managers and policymakers by showing that in the context of heritage, EMPs can include both technological and traditional approaches. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
              " 'Parks provide many benefits to society: environmental, social and economic, and need investment to continue to provide these benefits. An alternative to self-financing and commercial approaches involves building the publics perception of park benefits as a foundation for consequent investment by government. However, there is little empirical evidence to demonstrate public perceptions of benefits. We utilised a survey in Australia (n = 1,584) to investigate whether respondents perceptions of the benefits of parks are determined by information source and park use. The results suggest that users and non-users of parks who are exposed to a variety of information sources and more frequent use have a higher perception of parks benefits. Variety of information source was the primary explanation for positive perceptions of park benefits. In order to maximise public benefit-perceptions, communication between information providers needs to be coordinated and consistently implemented. Depending on the societal-benefit profile required, combining communication strategies with park use, including through tourism, would optimise efforts to build and sustain societal-benefit perceptions. We anticipate that this research will assist in developing park agencies confidence in implementing benefit-perception strategies, thereby furthering the publics support for conservation. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

In the same year, a utopian colony from the United States arrived. Whereas scholars have dismissed the latter and focused on the former, this essay unveils the science-inspired utopianism common to both enterprises. Investing science with the exclusive role of producing all knowledge and steering politics, leaders of the two initiatives aspired not only to protect nature but also to forge a new humanity. Describing how such ambitions burst along lines of race, class, and nationality, I argue that these enterprises consolidated the current understanding of the Galpagos as pristine: a site fit for research and tourism but unhospitable to (other) people. Drawing on archival and historical documents, this essay aims to reinvigorate two conversations: one between science and technology studies (STS) and conservation, and the other between STS and utopian studies. If recent attempts at bridging the divide between science and imagination have emphasized how powerful actors shape human society, this essay considers the long-lasting effects of scientific imaginaries on a politics of nature.',\n",
              " 'Disease transmission across borders may occur during the context of international travel and is a critical public health arena for study. This study examined the associations between personality factors (sensation seeking and impulsivity) and international travellers engagement in high-risk sexual behaviours during their trip(s) abroad. Overall, we found that the profile of high-risk and non-high-risk international travellers were statistically significantly different (i.e. high-risk international travellers had a higher tendency for sensation seeking and impulsivity; had a greater number of lifetime sexual partners; were more likely to be male, non-White, younger, non-married or not in a committed relationship, gay, lesbian or bisexual; and had lower educational attainment). Variables that positively predicted participants high-risk sexual behaviours were measures of impulsivity, number of sexual partners, gender (i.e. being male), and educational attainment. The participants age, however, was negatively associated with their high-risk sexual behaviours. Our study concurs with previous research findings suggesting that sensation seeking and impulsive behaviours are related to the practice of high-risk sexual behaviours. Findings from this study can be used to create more translational research in tourism for frequent international travellers.',\n",
              " 'This study attempts to approximate the boundaries of the American South using the frequency of dixie in the names of public establishments. Our analysis discovered anomalous clusters of these establishments in the immediate vicinity of the old Dixie Highway system. This nascent highway system acted as a significant driver of tourism and commercial development during the early 20th century. To verify the overrepresentation of dixie names along the route, we approximated the methods of prior studies, recording all instances of dixie from approximately 1,600 phone book directories in the con-tiguous 48 United States and mapping them by ZIP Code. Using this method, we find 39 percent of instances of dixie, in the ten states the system crossed, lie within a 0.5-kilometer buffer of the route. After removing these instances, we demonstrate that their exclusion significantly shrinks the regional hotspot. We conclude that prior scholarship utilizing this technique has inflated the size of the region by including instances of establishments named dixie to signal close proximity to the Dixie Highway system. Likewise, we conclude that qualitative scholarship on naming conventions, as well as the theoretical basis for using aggregated names as proxies for vernacular regions, are underdeveloped, and further work is needed in both areas.',\n",
              " 'The concept behind the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI; formerly One Belt, One Road) began to take shape in 2013. Since then, this Chinese-led project has become a major plank in Chinas foreign relations. The BRI has grown from its basis as a vision of interregional connectivity into a truly global system, encompassing placesincluding many island states, territories, and citiesfrom the South Pacific to the Arctic, from East Africa to the Caribbean, from the Indian Ocean to the Mediterranean. Islands and archipelagos are particularly prominent in the BRIs constituent 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (MSR) and Polar Silk Road or Ice Silk Road projects, but little scholarly attention has been paid to how the BRI relates to islands per se. This special section of Island Studies Journal includes nine papers on islands and the BRI, concerning such diverse topics as geopolitics, international law and territorial disputes, sustainability and climate change adaptation, international relations of autonomous island territories, development of outer island communities, tourism and trade, and relational understandings of archipelagic networks. Taken together, these papers present both opportunities and risks, challenges and ways forward for the BRI and how this project may impact both China and island and archipelago states and territories.',\n",
              " 'Groundwater is critical to human survival, however, it has constantly been overexploited around the world. Despite hydrological causes and the effects of global climate change, groundwater governance has an essential role to play in causing or preventing such overexploitation. This paper presented a case of groundwater governance in Lijiang, renowned for its natural beauty and exotic cultures, located in northwest Yunnan, China. Since being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in the 1990s, Lijiang has experienced dramatic tourism development, which eventually escalated its groundwater crisis. This paper applied the diagnostic approach of social-ecological systems to analyse the institutionalised governance process in the case of Lijiang and substantiated the effectiveness of the Social-Ecological Systems (SES) approach in explaining groundwater management issues. Two significant findings were drawn in the case of Lijiang. First, institutional arrangements may play an essential role in resource management, but their analysis is lacking between macro modelling of planetary boundaries of the Earth and micro surveys of individual and community behaviour. The SES framework offered a useful tool to fill this gap. Second, the designation of Lijiangs Outstanding Universal Values as a world heritage site ironically damaged its local cultural intimacy, which nurtured generations of collective action for Naxi people, escalating the tragedy of its groundwater commons.',\n",
              " 'This study is aimed at analyzing the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on the financial performance of Chinese listed companies. We applied pooled ordinary least square (OLS) regression as a baseline methodology to determine the effects of COVID pandemic on the financial performance of Chinese listed companies. We found that the small- and medium-sized companies are most affected by this pandemic, in addition to that our analysis has revealed that serious-impact areas and industries which were worst hit by the COVID-19 experienced a sharper decline in financial performance as compared to other industries. The findings of this study have broad implications for policymakers, as it is evident that governments, banks, regulatory bodies, and central banks must combine forces to tackle the financial and economic impacts of COVID-19 crises. They should come up with comprehensive policies to tackle the adverse impact of such crises in the future as well. Actions such as proving loans and rescheduling existing loans to worst-hit sectors such as tourism, airline industry, etc. are starting point.

              " 'This paper investigates the sectoral impacts of foreign direct investment (FDI) on growth in Egypt between 1990 and 2007 based on a unique data set. It highlights the aggregation bias inherent in many empirical studies that focus solely on the economy-wide effects of foreign investment. Aggregate inflows of FDI are shown to be detrimental to the countrys economic growth performance, possibly as a result of the crowding-out of more productive domestic investment. Some positive sector-specific effects, however, are found for investment in manufacturing and petroleum, which also has beneficial spillovers into other sectors. FDI in the finance and retail and telecommunications and information technology sectors are found to generate significantly negative growth effects, while those in services and tourism are negative but generally insignificant. These findings suggest that market-seeking FDI in certain sectors has conspicuous crowding-out effects, possibly owing to insufficient domestic absorptive capacity. The results of this study further demonstrate the importance of potential sectoral heterogeneity of own sector and inter-sectoral economic growth effects of FDI. It therefore highlights the critical need for policymakers to take a more disaggregated sectoral-level evaluation of the benefits of foreign investment, particularly in developing economies such as Egypt.',\n",
              " 'The islands of the western Pacific have increasingly been portrayed by policymakers, military strategists, journalists, and scholars as places caught between a rising China and traditional powers such as the United States and their allies. In this article, however, we aim to challenge the geopolitical view of islands as falling into the sphere of influence of one power or another. Specifically, we use an approach informed by assemblage theory to highlight the ways that islands in the Pacific simultaneously engage with multiple powers and their associated political, economic, and social influences. To ground our argument, we discuss two great power schemes that aim to bring islands in the region into specific relational configurations: U.S. littoral defense lines and Chinas Belt Road Initiative. We also include a brief case study of Chinese tourism investment in Yap Island (Waab) in the Federated States of Micronesia (which is a state in free association with the U.S.). Through these examples, we show how influence in the island Pacific is not a zero-sum game between foreign powers vying for hegemony. Instead, from an island perspective, residents and policymakers are attempting to weave together and navigate multiple foreign influences in ways that frustrate colonial and neocolonial logics of international relations.',\n",
              " 'Transnational gentrification is class-based neighbourhood change driven by relatively affluent international migrants. In contrast to the conventional globalisation narrative in which people are significantly more place-bound than capital flows, transnational gentrification suggests that a globally mobile capitalist class has been in large part responsible for rapid change in many urban neighbourhoods. Observations of transnational gentrification have accelerated over the past decade, with scholarly accounts reporting on cases in disparate locations  particularly those in Latin America and the Mediterranean with charming old-world architecture, significant cultural amenity and rents below OECD averages. In this article we attribute transnational gentrification in the 21st century to three primary drivers: new forms of tourism and short-term rentals; state-led initiatives to revitalise urban neighbourhoods and catalyse economic activity; and lifestyle-driven migration and new forms of consumption. We argue that transnational gentrification is not simply an outcome of a globalised rent gap but instead a product of a new global residential imaginary coupled with enhanced possibilities for transnational mobility facilitated by digital platforms and state-led efforts to extract new forms of rent from particular neighbourhoods. We conclude by offering a number of potential avenues for future research, many of which resonate with key themes that emerged decades ago as gentrification first began to transform cities and urban policy.',\n",
              " 'Gentrification demands updated frameworks to assess the impact of some major global trends on the local populations access to housing. Short-term accommodation using digital platforms in previously gentrified central urban areas is playing a significant role in outlining a new wave of transnational gentrification in a number of global cities. Having undergone classical patterns of gentrification over the last two decades, the central district of Madrid and its surroundings are showing patterns of a new wave of gentrification in a context of economic crisis, planetary rent gaps, increasing global tourism and an increase in rental prices in central areas that may be related to the emergence of short-term rentals  making Madrid a relevant case for depicting transnational gentrification in the Southern European capitals. Based on empirical data, this work explores the holiday rental supply in Madrid over three years (20152018), verifying a strong association between the growth in tourist arrivals, the settlement of new residents from wealthy economic backgrounds and increasing rental prices. Since this process is accompanied by deregulation of local rental contracts and the growth of transnational Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), even in some of the most vulnerable areas located beyond the M-30 ring road, this wave of gentrification has the potential to produce displacement and substitution of residents.',\n",
              " \"Skill shortages within the hospitality sector is a major problem. The evaluation was undertaken to establish if the TVET colleges are well equipped to have a meaningful impact on the provision of appropriate skills required by the hospitality industry. The study adopted a mixed method approach as part of the survey design. The inherent structure of the curriculum was benchmarked against the expectations of employers of TVET college graduates. Data was collected through the administration of a survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. The survey questionnaire specifically examined available infrastructure at the TVET colleges utilised for hospitality studies, training provided by the academic personnel, curriculum content and employers' expected curriculum outcomes. Seven principals, 14 lecturers and 22 employers were interviewed using a semi-structured interview schedule. The key findings of the study revealed that the curriculum on offer placed considerable emphasis on Catering and Hotel Management. Entrepreneurship and Business Management courses are only offered at N5 level and Communication and Human Relations are offered at N6 level, notwithstanding the fact that they are largely regarded as core skills within the hospitality and tourism industry. Students are afforded work integrated learning opportunities on completion of their studies. Employers observed that a large proportion lacked skills. There appears to be sustained reluctance on the part of academic personnel and institutional management to harness funding. There is a critical need for coherent alignment between curriculum content and the needs of the hospitality industry through periodic reviews.\",\n",
              " 'The Sausapor Declaration has served as a stepping stone towards convening and balancing the dynamics of governmental politics, conservation efforts, the protection of customary communities rights, and the sustainable management of natural resources in Tambrauw District. The Declaration supported the establishment of Tambrauw as a Conservation District, while also acknowledging the rights of customary communities in shaping political priorities of the local government, which include: a) stewardship of extensive remaining tropical forests (91.9% forest cover); b) management of protected areas, which represent 77-80% of the total area of the District; c) acknowledging the cultural traditions of five major indigenous groups; and, d) securing the active support of formal institutions for these goals. Two stages have shaped the effort to establish the Conservation District. The first stage involved the period prior to the formal declaration, while the second ecompasses development and implementation of related policies. Establishing local regulations and protecting local communities required extensive lobbying with the provincial and national government, as well as advocacy in various seminars, including both national and international conferences that provided strategic opportunities for securing support for the Conservation District. These steps have been instrumental in gaining legitimacy and public support for relevant conservation policies and for protecting the rights of customary communities. As one example, the review of Tambrauw spatial planning documents (RTRW) led to prioritizing eco-tourism as a leading sector for economic development, along with the creation of an overall agropolitan and renewable energy strategy.',\n",
              " 'Galpagos has been characterized with great abundance of marine life and high levels of endemism. Due to its geographical position, this archipelago experiences tremendous climate variability during El Nio events, which disturb the entire marine food web, and ultimately affect the artisanal fishing activity. In this study, we explored the main impacts of El Nio events on artisanal fishing and marine life using the local ecological knowledge provided by four generations of fishers on the most populated islands in Galpagos. Anecdotal information and perceptions coincided with the current scientific literature and provided novel insights about: (i) the positive and negative effects of the El Nio years on artisanal fisheries and marine animals, (ii) differences in species caught during warm and cold seasons and (iii) current interactions among artisanal fisheries, tourism and unauthorized industrial fisheries activities within the 40 nautical miles that surround the Galpagos Marine Reserve. In addition, fishers provided valuable information for governing resources under anomalously warm years, by identifying sites that function as natural refuges for fish and invertebrates during El Nio events. Data derived from these interviews highlight an urgent need for a novel, bottom-up and collaborative fisheries governance, between the artisanal fishing sector and decision and policy makers in Galpagos. Collaborative initiatives, involving one of the sectors that first inhabited the archipelago, is essential to achieve sustainable and long-term use of marine resources and to increase and anticipate human and environmental resilience under continued long-term global warming.',\n",
              " 'Transnational gentrification has become a key element of urban and sociocultural transformations in several Latin American countries. New urban policies and transnational real estate markets adapt the city in order to respond to the expectations of transnational middle classes. This paper explores the case of San Miguel de Allende in Mexico. Methodologically, it adopts a qualitative approach and analyses two of the most important manifestations of transnational gentrification: lifestyle migration and luxury tourism. Historical files on protected buildings in San Miguel de Allendes historic centre were used to observe functional alterations. This is supplemented with other statistical data (including the spatial pattern of Airbnb rentals) and direct observations of public spaces. I propose that transnational gentrification leads to a heritage-led transnationalisation of real estate, evidenced by luxury housing, boutique hotels, art galleries and other high culture spaces that cater to higher-income lifestyle migrants and tourists. As a result, the new class of owners and users changes the places identity, which has implications for lower-income groups right to the city. The process in San Miguel de Allende is analogous to processes in cities such as London, New York or Paris, where notions of heritage urbanism have also helped transnationalise local real estate markets. However, it also evinces other processes that are more difficult to appreciate in the Global North (growing rent gaps, real estate companies aggressive pursuit of gentrification and deep historical inequalities that are exacerbated by heritage-led gentrification).',\n",
              " 'The Great Recession (20082014) and the consequent crises in both the national financial and production systems have led the Portuguese administration to adopt tourism and urban rehabilitation as new pivotal sectors to overcome the critical crisis-derived impacts on the economy and society. Moreover, both national and local administrations have deployed a range of legislative initiatives to attract transnational real estate investment and new high-income residents to the country, including generous tax benefits and residency permits for large foreign investors. This is of greater relevance in the historic neighbourhoods of Lisbon city centre, as in the case of Alfama, which has recently been transformed into one of the most important urban hotspots in the country for both local and transnational real estate investors. By focusing on this historic quarter of Lisbon, this paper examines how processes of gentrification and studentification occurring in the area since the late 1990s and early 2000s have been disrupted by recent processes of touristification and Airbnbisation in Alfama, transforming the entire neighbourhood into an outdoor hotel. The paper concludes by suggesting that, while urban touristification appears today as a new reproduction mechanism of glocal financial capital, the Airbnbisation of former lower-class central urban areas of post-recession southern European cities emerges as the newest, most aggressive form of urban accumulation by dispossession and spatial displacement against the working and middle-lower classes (both locals and migrants) of the tourist city.',\n",
              " 'In 2014, the deadliest Ebola outbreaks in history erupted in West Africa and infected within a year nearly 30,000 people across the region. Besides its unprecedented human toll, the epidemic exacted significant economic losses through its spillover effect on employment, confidence, trade, and tourism. This paper examines the role of political inclusion in the vulnerability to the 2014 Ebola crisis in Guinea and Sierra Leone using a unique dataset on the ethnic composition of the ruling coalitions during the crisis. Exploiting subdistrict-level variation in Ebola incidents and assigning total infections to the majority ethnic group of the subdistrict, I analyze the effects of ethnic representation on local response to the outbreak. In an empirical analysis based on count data and linear regression models, I find that the allocation of one additional position to an ethnic group in a 30-member cabinet is associated with an 1823 percent decline in the subdistrict-level Ebola infection. While I find no effect on the risk of infection, I show that conditional on having any cases ethnic representation is associated with fewer Ebola incidents, suggesting a significant mitigation effect. This paper advances the debate about ethnic favoritism, but unlike existing studies focusing on individual leaders such as the president or a minister, it quantifies the effects of power-sharing on vulnerability to adverse shocks in a context of multi-ethnic ruling coalitions. Institutional reforms that limit the misallocation of public goods should be accompanied by concerted efforts to design need-based targeting.',\n",

Indeed, a study is required that can follow this goal using sustainability indicators. This study was conducted to develop a model to recognize the indicators of evaluating the Ecotourism Sustainability (EES) and to fill the gap of research for SED in the west of Iran. Accordingly, we identified 30 indicators in three dimensions (economic, social, and environmental) of sustainability for EES in six eco-touristic areas in the west of Iran. The best area (Gahar Lake) was selected using the Composite Index (CI). Then, we formulated and ranked the strategies in the SWOT-AHP-TOWS analysis. The results of the CI section showed that the weight of economic indicators in EES was greater than that of other dimensions. AHP analysis revealed that the most important criteria for the SED in Gahar Lake were the opportunities in this area. Also, according to the ranking of strategies extracted in the matrix of TOWS, the most important strategy was Advertising and introducing the beautiful nature of the lake nationally and internationally. Our main suggestion is for Irans Tourism Organization to pursue more serious negotiations with international organizations for the global registration of the lake as an ecotourism zone.',\n",

We argue that it is crucial to explore effective management models for rural communities relocated in the context of disaster risk management (DRM). We identify two dominating types of relocation communities (the characteristic tourism type and the urbanization type) and changes in livelihood assets and strategies and in ecological-living-industrial land spaces of the two types, and discuss the common and different traits of two types of DRM models and the effects on village residents livelihood regarding mudslide risk management in Changde Village and unstable landslide risk management in Dabashan Village, then further research deficiencies of the models and countermeasures in policy and institutional dimensions, based on the Vulnerability and Capacity Approach and the Sustainable Livelihood Approach.

              " 'The aims of this case study are to assess water quality in a small, forested mountain catchment in the Black Forest, forming part of a National Park and Natura 2000 zone. Field work was carried out in the catchment of the Seebchle torrent, a small headwater basin of the River Acher, a confluent of the Rhine, in Southern Germany between late winter and early summer of 2018. The catchment has a diverse natural setting of water bodies, including springs, torrents, and a lake, and is impacted by anthropogenic activities such as summer tourism, winter sports, two quarries, road traffic, and an isolated construction site. Physio-chemical and bacterial water samples were obtained at 10 measurement sites, including a spring, a lake (Mummelsee), a fountain, artificial and natural snow on and next to a ski run (Seibelseckle), artificial ditches and parking lots draining the ski run, and the Seebchle torrent above two granite mines. Samples were either taken directly on site or analyzed in corresponding hydrology and hospital microbiology laboratories. Water of the Seebchle is oxygen-rich, peaty, and mostly acidic, but the pH varies between 4.1 and 9.5 throughout the catchment, inclining towards acid in the fountain and below the ski run and towards alkaline in the lake. Conductivity is spatially highly variable, reaching the most elevated values below the ski run and its parking lot (149 S/cm). A high density of bacteria including enterobacteria was detected at nearly all sites. Human pathogenic bacteria were found below and surrounding the ski run, at parking lots draining the ski run, as well as at the lowest site during the mid-spring campaign. They were also detected in the touristically highly frequented lake and in the spring feeding the lake during the end-of-spring campaign. Whilst most physico-chemical parameters followed a similar pattern and fell within good to very good EU drinking water quality status, the lake turbidity levels (19.2 NTU) by far exceeded norms after ice thawing. The most contaminated site in terms of bacteria and turbidity (5.2 NTU), ammonium nitrogen (0.18 mg/L), and total nitrogen (5.06 mg/L) was the spring feeding the Mummelsee draining the construction site of a new restaurant. These field analyses show that the water quality of a virtually uninhabited, natural headwater catchment is strongly interconnected and can degrade both by direct and indirect impacts of overtourism.',\n",
              " 'Long-term land use/land cover (LULC) assessments, based on remote-sensing data, play a leading role in gathering information on land degradation that has an impact on food security, soil quality and species habitats with all the accompanying social implications. The aim of this study was to determine the LULC changes of severely degraded land using high-resolution remote-sensing data from the last ~50 years in order to determine whether human activities have led to improvements or further land degradation. An area of 70 km2 near Cherrapunji in Northeast India, which receives 11,000 mm of rainfall annually and was deforested in historical times, was selected for this analysis. Despite severe land degradation, the population density of this area has been continuously increasing, standing at ~300 inhabitants km2 in 2011. A visual interpretation technique, combined with field surveys, was used for LULC mapping, based on satellite images from the US Corona programme for 1965, pansharpened Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) images IRS-1D for 1998 and Google Earth for 2017. This analysis indicated the dominance of grassland (73.2%), with a small contribution of forest (17.6%), settlements (5.8%), mining (2.3%), cropland (0.7%) and water bodies (0.4%) in 2017. The LULC structure was the result of a largely degraded land contribution inherited from the past and the emergence of new driving forces behind land-use change. The LULC trends in 19652017 included a decrease of forest (4%) and grassland (5%), stability of cropland, and an increase of land-use classes which, in non-degraded land under a monsoonal climate, are usually of small extension, such as settlements (85%), mining (132%) and water bodies (525%). These changes reflect both, attempts to utilise existing environmental resources and to adapt to living in a degraded environment caused by growing human population. From the land degradation perspective, the trends in LULC change show two opposing directionsfurther land degradation mainly associated with the expansion of settlements and mining (accounting for ~79% of the total LULC changes), and land improvement and neutral change, including the recovery of natural vegetation and the construction of water bodies. The relationships between the LULC changes and direct measurements of biomass and carbon stocks of forest and grassland ecosystems indicated that their balance was negative for the Cherrapunji spur in 19652017. A strategy aimed at restoring the sustainability of the Cherrapunji spur environment should focus on the replacement of grassland by forest through the abandonment of uncontrolled grass burning, animal grazing and coal mining with the simultaneous provision of alternative gainful employment for the local population such as tourism and aquaculture.',\n",

However, the perceived abundance of Costa Rica's water resources is only true for part of the country. The same geography and climate that bring abundant precipitation to most of southern Costa Rica and its Caribbean coast also leave the northern Pacific province of Guanacaste with substantially less rainfall and even periods of severe drought. This case study focuses on Guanacaste province, which is a major tourist destination as well as one of the country's most productive agricultural regions. Water from the lush Caribbean slopes of the Lake Arenal region is transported across the continental divide through extensive infrastructure projects. Passing through the semi-arid regions of Guanacaste, hydroelectric power generation, extensive irrigated agriculture, and tourism development use most of the water, supporting a rapidly growing regional economy but leaving increasingly less water for environmental flows. This case study introduces students to nexus thinking to explore the multiple and overlapping water, energy, and food (WEF) demands and ecological challenges present in Guanacaste province. Each sector and its interconnections with other sectors are examined in turn through introductory lectures, and enriched by WEF systems thinking activities and class discussions. At the conclusion of this case study curriculum, students will be able to identify and characterize points of intersection, i.e., the nexus, of WEF supply and demand, and trade-offs that exist between WEF resources and biodiversity conservation.\",\n",

Its existence is vital to the survival of many pollinator insects and endangered bird species and to the integrity of multiple islands' watersheds. Rapid 'hi'a Death (ROD) is an emerging fungal disease that poses a significant health risk for these trees and is spread by human traffic, ambrosia beetles, and wind dispersal. Loss of 'hi'a forests will negatively affect Hawai'i's economy and ecology and will have detrimental impacts on Hawaiian culture, particularly because of the role of lehua flowers in hula. While transmission of ROD Death is not yet fully understood, human activity is currently considered the main proponent of its spread. Hawai'i's economy is largely built on the tourism industry; however, tourists are often unaware of the disease and the practices implemented to contain the current outbreak while visiting the Hawaiian Islands. ROD is a conservation issue that connects humans with the environment and must be addressed using a one-health perspective. This article aims to elucidate the anthropogenic factors contributing to the depletion of 'hi'a lehua through the spread of ROD and to propose prevention measures that can be adopted by citizens and visitors. At the end of this case study, readers will understand the cultural, ecological, and economic significance of 'hi'a lehua.

The results show that: (1) The geo-economic flows between China and South American countries show an overall increasing trend during 2006-2015. (2) China and South American countries have an unbalanced development in geo-economic linkages elements. The geo-economic linkage of transportation is higher than that of politics, tourism, investment and trade. (3) The geo-economic linkages intensity between China and South American countries are at a low level and varies significantly among countries. (4) The geo-economic linkages intensity between China and South American countries is slowly increasing, and the changes in spatial pattern are small year by year. (5) Gross domestic product, population size and cooperative goldenstein factor are the dominant factors influencing the geo-economic linkages intensity between China and countries in South America. Market is the most important driving force for geo-economic linkages intensity between China and countries in South America. Resource endowment has little effect on the geo-economic linkages intensity, while geopolitics has a significant effect on the geo-economic linkages intensity.',\n",
              " 'National park system is currently widely used as a protected area pattern in various countries around the world. Based on the relevant documents of the \" Web of Science Core Collection from 1990 to 2019, this paper analyzes the knowledge map of the international research status of national park management system using CiteSpace software. The re- sults show that the research on international national park management system in the past three decades can be divided into three stages. Since 2016, this field has been receiving more attention from international scholars. Most of the academic re- searches come from the United States, Australia, Canada, and other countries and institutions. The proportion of relevant research from China is small. Tourism or recreation, protection, and community are the three main issues studied in the field of national park management system in the past three decades. The corresponding objects of management research are roughly citizens or consumers, national park ecosystems, and stakeholders surrounding communities. Consumer behavior or preferences, management policies or guarantees, and benefit distribution mechanisms are the three key points of manage- ment system research. Econometric model analysis is currently an important research method in the field. Important re- search frontiers in this field include national park tourism or recreation under the concept of conservation, coordination of interests between community and national park, and recreation service of national park based on tourists perception. This paper provides suggestions for the development of Chinas national parks from the following three aspects: top-level system construction, fund guarantee system, and community coordination mechanism.',\n",

The analysis lays out the foundations with a review of the literature on the creative economy and builds upon them with the terminology of creative industries and industrial districts. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis lays out the foundations with a review of the literature on the creative economy and builds upon them with the terminology of creative industries and industrial districts. A three-dimensional representation is developed, from a perspective in which the three dimensions comprise university, creative industries and government, combined with seven underlying factors that define the archetypal framework from the perspective of the creative economy of the region's handcrafts. Findings: Working from the principal of an analysis of underlying factors, the paper presents an ethnographic study of the potentials and obstacles present in the handcrafts sector and delineates the work that remains to be done to enable construction of a creative economy. Originality/value: A prominent possibility based on the ethnographic study of the potentials listed, the creative economy of the handicraft sector is underexplored in the Amazon. Based on the Amazon heritage of the people in the Alto Solimes region, future prospects such as establishment of guilds, clusters and internationalization of production in a tourism association represent sui generis potentials for the economic development of the Alto Solimes region of the Brazilian Amazon.\",\n",
              " 'Within tourism research, trust has largely been conceptualised from psychological perspectives, allowing insights into the mechanisms through which resident/stakeholder relations generate trust. Whilst this work is valuable in understanding dynamics of trust relations, such focus has meant less attention and has been given to the ways space influences trust in tourism contexts. Thus, a geographical approach is put forth to understanding trust in tourism. Through observation and semi-structured interviews concerned with the implementation of a community tourism project in southwest China, insights are provided illustrating how trust is inscribed in place. It is shown that in the Chinese context, cultural place-based specificities relating to pre-existing governance structures, social hierarchies, and the intersection of power, knowledge and trust influence the (in)abilities of NGOs to develop trust with specific residents. More meaningful dialogue between tourism research and geographical conceptualisations of trust is called foras a way to attend to spatial and scalar differences in understanding of trust within tourism contexts.',\n",
              " 'Despite the growing use of sanctions as a post-Cold War foreign policy instrument, there is limited research on sanctions in a tourism context despite their substantial impact on destinations and tourist flows. Although there is significant research on sanctions in political science, international relations, economics, and public policy, very few studies explicitly examine the effect of sanctions on tourism. This study therefore examines the intricate geopolitical relationship between sanctions and tourism via a scoping review of relevant literature. Each of the four main types of sanctions that were identified: financial, sectoral, diplomatic and individual, have different implications for tourism at various scales. The findings show that tourism is profoundly affected by sanctions impacting tourism and hospitality businesses and destination image, severely restricting international travel, and disrupting financial investment and supply chains. More comprehensive sanctions may lead to substantial economic and personal hardship in destinations as well as indirect effects including decline in the value of currency and inflationary pressures. Nevertheless, despite the development of smart and targeted sanctions they rarely affect the coercive capacity of the targeted government and induce political behavioural change. Resistive economies can develop in response to sanctions in which domestic tourism assumes greater significance as a result of reductions in international mobility. Some destinations facing sanctions also focus on specific international markets from non-sanctioning countries as well as a countrys diaspora. Overall, the study of sanctions deepens knowledge of the interrelationships between geopolitics, foreign policy and tourism and its ramifications for destinations. Significant gaps in knowledge for future research include the role of domestic politics in influencing sanctions policy, the selection of tourism as a specific target for sanctions, and the development of destination adaptation strategies to sanctions.',\n",
              " 'The research adopts the mobilities approach to examining the everyday experience of tour guides. Scholars tend to highlight guides as service providers and cultural brokers, whose activities and feelings seem to be subordinate to tourism consumption. In contrast, the research moves beyond the context of business and economy and seeks to resituate tour guiding in ordinary life. It draws on the ethnographic fieldwork in Sanya, a coastal city in south China, and adopts the methods of secondary data collection, interviews and participant observation for data generation. Specifically, the research scrutinises how tourism mobilities are embedded into the production of local guides daily practices, emotions and feelings. Tour guiding is characterised by movement/stillness, instability and contested meanings. On working days, guides travel with tourists between scenic sites, receiving unstable income. The mobile work greatly shapes their everyday rhythms, social networks, familial lives and identities. On jobless days, guides are likely to confine ordinary practices to residence and suffer from deep anxiety. Immobilities arouse their feelings of inability and worries about the future, thus lowering their expectations of career and personal development. The research problematises the idiosyncrasy of tour guiding and underscores its close relationship with the production of everyday practices and experience, thus giving a wider view on tourism work. In so doing, it also enriches our understanding of the complexity of tourism mobilities and contributes to the debate on the de-differentiation of tourism.',\n",
              " \"Previous research suggests that tourism has a role to play in challenging the destructive dominant narratives of the Israeli-Palestinian contextdiscourses that traditionally have, and still do, revolve around sectarianism, Othering and violence. Our case study focuses on a hostel in the Palestinian city of Ramallah that boldly attempts to challenge the way tourists view the Israeli-Palestinian context and Palestine as a tourism destination. We examine how the hostel attempts to achieve this and the ways in which being a hostel (as opposed to a hotel) helps its guests with this reframing through in-depth qualitative interviews conducted on-site with members of the hostel management and staff, and through participant observation conducted by the researchers in Ramallah. Findings shed light on the hostels ability to enable Israelis and Palestinians to cooperate within tourism, and how Palestine has much more to offer tourists than conflict-related tourism, thus challenging the master narratives of the region which have suggested quite the contrary. A key finding is the hostel's on-going attempt to remove ignorance about the situation in the region and promote fact-based learning. The results also suggest that the very characteristics of a hostel assist in achieving this mission through the intimate interactions that are inherent in a hostel setting. Hostels can, therefore, be part of a wider approach to ensuring tourism is used to promote alternative, positive narratives of contested space, as opposed to promoting division and externalising the conflict, as is so often the case.\",\n",

A piece of cheese conveys sense of place, nature, cultural processes, and ways of making and tasting. The imaginaries of cheese production and consumption are evident in both developing and developed countries. Every land has its own cheese, and through this product provides a particular taste of territory. In essence, this taste defines issues such as agro-livestock activities, health, leisure practices and food tourism attractions. The objective of this research is to discuss the role of cheese in liquid modernity. To achieve this, cheese narratives and imaginaries become the focus through which slow consumption, slow life or slow tourism are communicated and experienced through cheese as a philosophy for living in a contemporary liquid world. The unique case of agriculture and cheese production in New Zealand provides an example.',\n",

This study incorporates the insight of mutual dependence, and proposes a model of selective coercion to explain how the state coerces Chinese private firms for environmental investment. Findings reveal that the local state is more likely to coerce firms that are more dependent on the state through political connections and less likely to coerce those which are highly important to local tax revenues and those which are substantially costly for regulation enforcement. Provinces that are more dependent on tourism economy exert harder coercion on firms, whereas those that place higher priority on economic development exert lighter coercion on firms.

During fieldwork in the Makushi village of Surama, the author was frequently told how the wet and dry seasons have become irregular, the temperature has increased, and ecological changes have occurred in the forests and savannas. These perceived changes impact Makushi subsistence practices and have emerged concurrent with the local development of eco-tourism and increased interactions with outside entities in Surama. The author examines local ontological shifts related to these expanded interactions with outsiders, who advocate concepts of climate change, sustainability, and conservation. Recent encounters with climate change and outside entities in Guyana provide an ethnographic case of the broader climatic and related changes occurring in Amazonia. This case is analysed herein through an ontological approach. Based on fieldwork data, the author examines how local transformations are situated within the greater dimensions of the Anthropocene.',\n",

The empirical results show that the economic resilience index (ERI) using the TOPSIS method presents an increasing trend for all the disaster-affected counties from 2008 to 2016, indicating that the economy in all the counties continues to recover from the Wenchuan earthquake; however, there is a large spatial variability amongst them. Most counties with a tourism-based economic model have lower resilience index but higher average growth rate than those without. The effect of tourism on economic resilience utilizing Quantile regression method shows that the coefficients on tourism specialization vary across the quantiles of the economic resilience index, indicating the existence of a nonlinear tourism-growth nexus.',\n",

However, research on investor behaviour in investment crowdfunding is extremely limited in this area, particularly with respect to the impacts of venture quality, uncertainty, and funding amounts. To investigate this gap, a comprehensive and integrated model on the effects of venture quality and uncertainty level is developed and tested on crowdfunding participation in investing in visitor economy projects in South Korea. Results show that venture quality and uncertainty level had significantly positive impacts on crowdfunding participation which, in turn, highly influences word-of-mouth and re-participation. The funding amount invested was found to moderate the relationships among those constructs in the research model. Consequently, this study offers new insights for researchers and industry stakeholders in investment crowdfunding in the tourism and leisure sectors.',\n",

Interviews undertaken with volunteer tourists in Cusco, Peru, and on-the-ground participant observation, provide insights into what we term a volunteer tourist gaze underpinned by neo-colonial tendencies. The findings demonstrate that volunteer tourists are not passive consumers of a destination, but actively engage in a multi-sensory, embodied experience. This is evidenced in the way they describe their interactions with local people, and their views and perceptions of poverty in Cusco. However, the findings suggest that the volunteer-host interactions and experiences do little to foster cross-cultural understanding, particularly given the limitations to these interactions imposed by a significant language barrier. Instead, the commodified volunteer tourist gaze perpetuates neo-colonial discourses by emphasizing the differences between volunteer tourists from the developed world (the haves) and host communities in the Global South (the have nots).',\n",

Self-congruity and functional congruity represent two cost-effective but inadequately researched ways for guest houses to maintain customers. In view of the lack of empirical research explaining the post-purchase behavior of guest house customers, the purpose of this study is to develop a congruity-based customer loyalty model for this specialized type of accommodation. Design/methodology/approach: Based on a review of relevant literature, a robust conceptual framework of customer loyalty comprising satisfaction, self-congruity, functional congruity, perceived value and attractiveness of alternates was constructed. By means of an online panel survey, 828 valid questionnaires were obtained from customers who had stayed in a Chinese guest house within the previous year. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the conceptual model and the hypothesized relationships among the constructs. Findings: Significant relationships were found between the two congruity constructs in guest houses, which both led to positive customer post-purchase behaviors. The authors found that self-congruity, functional congruity and the attractiveness of alternates did not affect customer loyalty directly; rather, they influenced loyalty indirectly through customer satisfaction. Originality/value: This study developed a unique, congruity-based model of customer loyalty in the context of guest houses. It enhances the body of knowledge regarding congruity in the field of tourism and hospitality, and it discusses relevant implications of the findings for tourism marketing researchers and for owner-managers of guest houses.',\n",

Hiking, which is known to be a soft adventure activity, represents an especially important product for many tourism destinations around the globe and in the European Alps. However, little research has explored hikers underlying motivation and experiences, which are expected to differ from the hard adventure context, as mountain hiking provides a low risk, but high immersion. This paper aims to determine and explore the underlying dimensions and dynamics of mountain hikers soft adventure motivation (SAM). Design/methodology/approach: A concurrent mixed-method design that builds on a quantitative survey (N = 379) and qualitative interviews (N = 14) was used to explore SAM factors. This study combined exploratory factor analysis and regression analysis with semi-structured interviews and template analysis. Findings: The quantitative results provide six SAM factors and emphasize that relaxation, socializing and discovery contribute to hiking satisfaction, while recognition has adverse effects. By triangulating these findings with hikers experiences, this study underlines the associated recreational meaning of hiking and provides an in-depth qualitative discussion of SAM factors and the subordinate role of recognition. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is a refined understanding of SAM in the hiking context by emphasizing the recreational meaning of mountain hiking. As a result, this study adds an important missing link to previous outdoor tourism and leisure studies by showing the special composition and dynamics of SAM.

              " 'The objective of this research is to propose a theoretical model based on studies on residents quality of life in smart tourism destinations. Smart tourism destinations are territories based on information and communication technologies (ICT), which improve travelers tourist experiences as well as affect the quality of life of residents. To know the context of the relationships between tourism and quality of life, main studies and theories regarding these two phenomena are analyzed. Likewise, the relationship between smart places and quality of life is also studied. Therefore, a theoretical model on residents quality of life in smart tourism destinations is proposed based on a systematized analysis of the literature. From the theoretical model, it is perceived that residents overall life satisfaction results from the relationship between perceived tourism impacts and satisfaction with specific life factors, and they are measured by qualitative indicators. Also, it is identified that the quality of life of residents is clearly influenced by the impacts of tourism and ICTs. In addition, it is understood that the residents overall life satisfaction corroborates for the further development of the smart tourism destination. Finally, we understand that the knowledge of residents perception and satisfaction of their quality of life contribute to formulation and implementation of urban and tourism development policies in smart tourism destinations.',\n",

According to a logarithmic regression function that estimates the inverse demand-income elasticity, it has been found that tourism flows are not the best measure to use in assessing the contribution of tourism to economic growth. Rather, the volume of income that is generated from these tourists should be considered. Furthermore, based on an analysis of correlations, it was found that the territories having the greatest efficiency in generating income from tourism are more competitive in terms of tourism. The results obtained may contribute to changing the approach used by both private and public bodies, and they may also help them to re-focus their business planning and policymaking so as to emphasize an increase in income level and not in volume of tourists.',\n",

Novel spatiotemporal data from social media is employed to test the simulation results. It is found that the transfer probability matrices of the simulation results and social media data are highly correlated and, as a consequence, the tourism circle division is almost unanimous. This means the ABTSM can effectively simulate tourists spatiotemporal behaviour and be applied in the planning and management of tourism and transportation.',\n",

Due to this tourism crisis, this research attempted to uncover the possible influence of the corporate social responsibility efforts of the international tourism businesses and of the knowledge of COVID-19 on the US travelers decision formation for international tourism products. A quantitative approach and survey methodology were used. The findings revealed that corporate social responsibility improves travelers attitudes and behavioral intentions. In addition, the travelers knowledge perception of COVID-19 was significantly associated with their psychological distress. Decreasing this psychological distress related to overseas tourism was of importance to boost a positive attitude toward international traveling, which directly leads to increased behavioral intentions.

While pro-environmental behavior in the domestic context is well-studied, virtually no research has examined consistency in PEBs across domestic and tourism contexts. Here, we examined potential consistency and spillover effects between PEBs in domestic and tourism contexts using at 717-participant questionnaire study dataset, analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation modeling (PLS-SEM). We also considered potential mediators and moderators of these relationships. The results show significant positive relationships between domestic PEBs and tourism PEBs, with environmental attachment and pro-environmental identity positively related, and moral licensing beliefs negatively related, to consistency between PEBs in both contexts. Pro-environmental identity and moral licensing beliefs were found to partly mediate the association between PEBs in both contexts, whereas environmental attachment had a positive moderating effect. We discuss the implications of these results for strengthening positive relationships between domestic and tourism PEBs, and thus fostering cross-contextual spillover. ; 2020 The Author(s).

The value of our work lies not only in its provision of theoretical insights, but also in its potential to inform policy-making activities aimed at the promotion of the sustainable growth of tourism in Coxs Bazar, where concerns and expectations related to the sector remain overlooked. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
              " 'Bosnia and Herzegovina (B&H) possess many natural resources that can be exploited for the development of medical tourism. The offer of medical tourism in B&H is focused on spa tourism. B&H has 16 registered spa-centers offering different types of services. This study provides a complete overview of the assessment of the current state of spa-centres using expert decision-making and methods of multi-criteria analysis. An innovative and novel MCDM model based on integration of the FUCOM (full consistency method) and fuzzy MARCOS (Measurement of Alternatives and Ranking according to COmpromise Solution) methods was used. The model consists of 16 alternatives and eight sustainable criteria. The results of this research have shown that the spa-centers of Ilida near Sarajevo, Fojnica and Vruica have the best assessments of the current situation and prerequisites for sustainable business. These spa-centers should be a benchmark to other spas providing direction on how to improve their business to be more sustainable and competitive in the market. These results were confirmed by a sensitivity analysis with two approaches used. The first approach was to compare the results obtained by the fuzzy MARCOS method with other fuzzy methods, and the second approach was to examine the influence of the application of different weights on the final ranking of the spa. The results of this study can serve spa-canter managers to understand the position of their spa-centers in order to exploit advantages they have and eliminate the shortcomings to improve their business.',\n",
              " 'Small and medium-sized tourism companies (SMEs) strongly depend on their collaborators to achieve competitiveness and sustainability. In this sense, these organizations need to identify those factors that help them to use their resources and efforts to achieve the aforementioned goals. This article proposes a model oriented to organizational sustainability in the tourism sector. A systemic approach was adopted to articulate this research; therefore, the soft systems methodology was applied to structure the problem and express a conceptual model that suggests relationships as an alternative solution to the expressed problem. Partial least squares path modeling was applied to statistically validate the relationships expressed in the construct. Results suggest that the relationships proposed in the construct are valid and may promote organizational sustainability. The ideas developed are restricted to the organizational domain and although the results apply in a Mexican context, this potential limitation can be offset by the multi-methodological approach proposed, extending the models application to other types of organizations. This study may enable scholars and managers to improve communication and inter-organizational relationships, allowing organizations to focus their strategies and efforts using systems thinking to increase responsiveness and adaptation.',\n",
              " 'Tourist motivation, as a core of travel behavior, significantly influences consumer intentions and has attracted academic attention for decades. A plethora of studies analyse sets of internal and external motivators, while methodologies that exclusively focus on a single factor, such as age, that can sometimes have a determining influence in multi-attraction destinations, are less prevalent. This study introduces a fuzzy logic approach to develop a new model for analysing the internal motivations of different-aged consumers in multi-attraction urban destinations. Fuzzy models, as a mathematical means of representing vagueness and imprecise information, have the capability of recognizing, representing, manipulating, interpreting, and utilizing data and information, which typically for urban tourist motivations, are vague and lack certainty. This research tests the model in a real-life setting, using the example of Novi Sad, a mid-sized European city, which is typical of many similar cities who are attempting to develop sustainable tourism by attracting older tourists. The new model shows how tourist motivations for multi-attraction destinations are affected by age, through a specially developed m-file for MATLAB, so that it can be applied and tested in other tourism contexts. Theoretical and practical implications for sustainable destination management and marketing are described.',\n",
              " 'For tourist cities, the ecological footprint not only affects tourism competitiveness but also affects green development. This paper adopted an improved ecological footprint accounting model, used a series of relevant indicators of ecological footprint to compare the green development efficiency, and explored the main driving factors of the per capita ecological footprint and city classification of 16 major tourist cities in China from 2000 to 2017. The results show that the green development efficiency of the studied tourist cities still needs to be improved. Secondly, the panel data analysis shows that the proportion of the primary industry in GDP, the proportion of the secondary industry in GDP, the per capita investment in fixed assets, and the length of highways per 10,000 people can increase the per capita ecological footprint. Then, the cluster analysis divides the selected tourist cities into four categories, and different types of cities need to be managed differently. Finally, this paper puts forward corresponding suggestions to improve the quality of the green development of selected tourist cities. The in-depth study of the ecological footprint in this paper will provide a scientific basis for tourist cities to promote green economic growth that considers ecological footprint and GDP and achieve sustainable development of tourism.',\n",
              " 'In the last few years, natural protected areas have been facing great challenges and degradation around the world. Among this, environmental sustainability has become a priority to create harmony between tourists and nature. Tourists visiting protected areas are becoming progressively more concerned regarding the environment. Moreover, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have highlighted the potential role of young tourists to contribute to sustainable tourism. However, very few studies have focused on tourists environmentally sustainable behavior towards natural protected areas. To fill the existing gap in the literature, this study aims to provide a theoretical framework that includes environmental sustainability awareness (ESA) in measuring millennial tourists environmentally sustainable behavior (ESB). Thus, this study delivers an integrated approach based on the value-belief-norm (VBN) theory and the concept of the new ecological paradigm (NEP) towards protected areas. A self-administered questionnaire survey was conducted from one of the protected areas located in the north of Sichuan province of China, and 511 responses were obtained for statistical analysis. Results of the structural statistical analysis showed that the unified model includes a satisfactory level of predictive power for tourists ESB, which was superior to existing theories and concepts. The findings also revealed that all proposed relationships of the variables were significant and identified the positive influence of environmental sustainability awareness in generating the ESB. This study contributes towards sustainable tourism development and the conservation of protected areas, with several practical implications for local authorities in terms of millennial participation.',\n",

The purpose of this paper is to fill the gap in the social sciences and business management literature by providing a theoretical Sustainable Strategic Management Model (SSMM) proposal for the Fourth Sector (4S), Small-and Medium-sized (SMEs) Hotel companies (4S-SM-HCs), which are committed and have the will to contribute firmly to the 2030 Agenda. Based on their corporate purpose and aligned with the SDGs, this article provides a holistic proposal with a multi-stakeholder approach, adding the SDG perspective. Through a qualitative research methodology based on two focus groups in which the main stakeholders and the management team of the 4S-SM-HC under examination took part, a theoretical SSMM is co-defined so that the hotel company can make significant contributions to the five areas of the SDGs. Basing their structure on the internationally recognized Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) Criteria and co-created through social learning, this SSMM proposes four strategic management axis and develops ten principles of ethical performance (PEP). The main contributions of this article are two: (1) to provide an ecosystemic SSMM proposal to the 4S-SM-HCs to allow them to make significant contributions to the SDGs, and (2) to facilitate a methodological framework with a multi-stakeholder approach and SDG perspective to enable them to contribute to the wellbeing of people, the community and the planet.',\n",

The results from the panel data econometric analyses, accounting for cross-sectional dependency and slope heterogeneity issues, showed that higher degrees of intra-regional trade between the South Asian economies exert positive impacts on the IITD in South Asia. Similarly, undergoing a RET was found to stimulate the IITD further. Besides, the joint favorable impacts of regional trade integration and RET on South Asias IITD were also ascertained. Therefore, these findings impose key policy implications concerning the pertinence of strengthening regional trade cooperation between the South Asian neighbors and boosting renewable energy consumption for enhancing the IITD further.',\n",
              " 'With the exhibition sector becoming increasingly important for the hospitality and tourism industry, it is critical to understand what drives the success of an exhibition. Through a comprehensive literature review, we first identified two broad categories of factors, namely exhibition attributes and exhibitor perceptions, that influence exhibitor satisfaction and loyalty. Next, a meta-analysis was conducted based on 26 empirical papers studying the Chinese exhibition market to quantitatively evaluate these relationships. The results show that among the exhibition attributes, booth management, service personnel, and exhibition environment are the most important factors affecting exhibitor satisfaction, while exhibition brand is the most important factor affecting loyalty. Among exhibitor perceptions, service quality is more important for satisfaction, while perceived value is more meaningful to loyalty. This study offers insights into strategies for exhibition organizers to cultivate long-term relationships, and to better cope with the challenges of emerging forces such as the Internet.',\n",

To that end, niche theory, which presents the three core concepts of niche breadth, niche overlap, and niche superiority, was combined with gratification in the uses to apply the gratification niche analysis technique. Based on an extensive literature review, four factors (core functions, system functions, service functions, and additional functions) to measure user satisfaction levels by function with GDSs were extracted. Online/offline questionnaire surveys were conducted with travel agencies airline counter staffs who had experience using all four GDSs, and in total, 324 copies of the questionnaire were used in the analysis. The analysis results confirmed that Sabre had a competitive edge in general over the other three GDSs, while TOPAS (Amadeus) and Galileo had a comparative competitive edge in certain functions. This study suggested concrete implications that can help individual GDSs in terms of their development of functions or the establishment of marketing strategies by verifying user satisfaction by the function of individual GDSs.',\n",

The keeping of animals in captivity has become an increasingly contentious issue requiring zoos and marine parks to reposition themselves to remain viable as tourism enterprises to be sustained into the future. Recent protests by animal rights activists in Australia exemplifies the ideological challenges to the keeping of marine animals in captivity. To survive and thrive all organisations including marine parks must present an ideologically sustainable position which is consistent through their messaging and practices. Participant observation and discourse analysis are applied in this study to reveal the messaging employed by Sea WorldGold Coast, Australia in two separate years, and by doing so to identify the changes in legitimation framing over the period. Examples of onsite signage and live animal shows at the theme park, demonstrate that the legitimating discourses have shifted from its role in educating the public about marine animals and conservation in 2015, to highlighting its role as authorised, expert facility understood as a place of refuge to care for individual animals in 2018. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
              " 'Coastal management without scientific data or modern techniques has been implemented successfully by many coastal communities, and traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which is regarded as a culturally framed belief system, has played an important role in the successful cases. TEK of flyingfish culture in the Orchid Island was proved to have a theoretical basis and advantages in managing the flyingfish resource. However, modernization, introduction of modern techniques (motorized boats), development of tourism, and numerous other factors have caused TEK to change or disappear, and integration of TEK with the modern science of environmental management may be a solution to sustain the marine resource. TEK constitutes numerous taboos and norms (T&N). This study, for the first time, itemized the T&N of the flyingfish culture by category, with plausible motives explained by the respondents through in-depth interviews of tribespeople in 2014 and 2015, and identified the T&N with ecological conservation implications. The study also implemented a sampling scheme to provide the first records of fishery composition, flyingfish catch amount (about 260,000280,000 fish per year), and the catch rate for the island. Finally, this study discussed three interrelated approaches for sustainable management of the flyingfish resource, including integration of TEK with science-based monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS), and research.',\n",
              " 'In a context of increasing intercity competition, one of the major goals of the cities is to attract business services, in particular knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS). In spite of recognized importance of some locational determinants, already identified in the literature, not all of the determinants of KIBS locational choices are known. Studies that considered city reputation as a possible antecedent of KIBS location are scarce. This study aims to examine the influence of city reputation on technology-KIBS urban concentration. Building on the theoretical arguments that support the geographic centrality of high-order services, the study shows that different combinations of antecedent conditions can justify a high concentration of technology-KIBS (T-KIBS) in urban areas, including the combination of city reputation with access to clients. The results support the idea that geographical proximity to clients is also important in technology-related industries, in particular the ones that are knowledge-intensive. The findings suggest that tourism policies that enhance city reputation can be included in cities strategies designed to attract business services. Furthermore, it is highlighted that policy-makers do not need to improve all conditions to improve the city competitiveness and they can use different combinations of factors to attract T-KIBS.',\n",

As a direct result of the pandemic, the hospitality and tourism sectors have shut down, and business failure rates have occurred exponentially. The franchise hospitality industry has experienced significant impact and challenged a basic understanding of knowledge management (KM) implementation in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak. A strategic KM implementation practice can not only guide a large-scale operation, but also adjust an organizations performance and competitiveness. The purpose of this study is to examine the influential criteria of success through effective KM implementation and to predict the probability of successful KM in a post-pandemic era. The conceptual framework for KM applies an analytic hierarchical prediction model reliant upon consistent fuzzy preference relations to assist the franchise hospitality sectors consciousness of the influential criteria. An empirical case study is used to apply pairwise comparisons used to determine the priority weights and two possible outcomes. The case study will assist franchise organizations to analyze whether or not to implement KM, interdict application, or adopt revised actions. This assistance will enhance the success possibility of KM implementation within such a crisis environment. This study uses a case setting by assessing 15 franchises hospitality experts opinions in Taiwan relevant to KM implementation.',\n",

With the acknowledged objective of attracting foreign investments and tourists, the second city of Colombia has been consecutively branded as innovative, smart, sustainable and lately as a resilient city. Since 2016 and the integration of the city as one of the first members of the 100 Resilient Cities network pioneered by the Rockefeller Foundation, Medellins authorities have emphasised urban resilience as a core value of the city and its residents. Until now, few studies have put into perspective the notion of branding with that of resilience. By looking closely at discourses on the promotion of the city, as well as its burgeoning tourism sector, this article aims to fill this gap by providing a thorough analysis of the way urban resilience is used as a city-brand in a city still struggling to overcome high levels of violence. This study aims to show that antagonists visions of resilience are at stake when comparing the branding discourses of public authorities and the representations of self-settled communities who are at the centre of these narratives. While branding discourses praise the resilience of Medellin communities, many in these same communities tend to reject this vision of resilience as self-reliance (adaptation) and instead call for structural changes (transformation).',\n",
              " 'In an analysis of the reconstruction measures in the old city or Lalitpur (Patan) after the 2015 earthquakes in Nepal, it is shown that, contrary to usual assumptions, the reconstruction was not only concentrated on the prominent, strongly internationally promoted and financed world cultural heritage sites, but took also place at smaller sitesespecially at arcaded platform (phalc), small monasteries and shrines throughout the city. While the larger royal squares, often at the heart of tourism and heritage policies, are important for the status and hierarchy of kings, queens and associated castes, the smaller and possibly less visually spectacular buildings and rituals off the 5-Star map (the intangible heritage) are not less and are possibly even more relevant to inhabitants. Understanding this intangible heritage requires a different approach to what heritage means and how it is experienced from a more vernacular perspective. Rather than being firmly defined, heritage, and the reconstruction thereof, dynamically and controversially shapes how the disaster of the earthquake has been experienced, and is also connected to larger discourses on urban and social transformation and to concepts of ethnicity, nation and citizenship as well as social, symbolic prestige and economic status and distinction. The Gorkha Earthquakes have also produced a rich field of vernacular heritage formations and processes that enable us to consider heritage as placemaking. In this context, controversial concepts like authenticity as well as various qualities and temporalities of community participation and formation should be considered.',\n",
              " 'It has been well established that gentrification can undermine access to green amenities for socially vulnerable residents through socio-cultural or physical displacement from working-class and minority neighbourhoods. However, in the growing literature on environmental gentrification, little attention has been given to the impacts of gentrification on young families and children, especially in neighbourhood green spaces where children socialise and play. Using observational methods, surveys and interviews, we assessed perceptions and use of green play spaces in two neighbourhoods of Barcelona at different stages of gentrification. One neighbourhood suffers from advanced residential, commercial and tourism-led gentrification (La Ribera) while the other (Poblenou) experiences more recent gentrification. We find that advanced and more complex processes of gentrification are more likely to be associated with dissatisfaction of public space and less use by children and families. We also observe lower levels of trust, increased delinquency and a greater sense of insecurity. In contrast, early-stage gentrification is linked to new place relations and attachment around green play spaces that are highly used by children and their families. Yet, our research also shows that neighbourhood gains in terms of increased access and use of green play spaces might be short-lived as residents there point to fear of displacement. Our findings thus reveal how gentrification can operate to offer short-term green benefits but possible long-term losses for socially vulnerable families in gentrifying neighbourhoods.',\n",

It is evident that these have been harmful for tourism, passenger transport, and the service sector in general. However, less is known regarding the implications for manufacturing and logistics, which is the purpose of this research. We concentrate on reporting survey findings from Northern Europe, and mostly from Finland. Based on trade accounts, it is evident that Covid-19 has had significant impacts on Finnish import and export. However, in survey responses, companies report that they have mostly been able to serve customers in a good fashion, and the pandemic has increased transportation costs only moderately. Inventories might experience an increase due to the virus, however, in the longer term they will likely remain at the earlier levels (or slightly increase). Companies are mostly afraid of the effects of the second wave of the epidemic, and are also already thinking about the long-term issues with transportation modes used together with supply chain dependencies. For example, the Chinese and, in part, Russian, markets are increasingly being served by railways during the current decade. For some companies (especially small and medium-sized ones) and foreign trade markets, however, the epidemic era has been very harmful. Therefore, as a conclusion we argue that the pandemic is causing rather asymmetrical impacts on manufacturing and logistics.',\n",

Institutional flexibility, broad participation, multilevel governance, and adaptability have been identified as critical conditions for the governance of social-ecological systems. While the importance of agency, through the substantive participation of private actors in rulemaking, has been researched, there is a need to examine the dynamics involved in, and consequence of, hybrid governance arrangements. An empirical study is presented of hybrid governance, involving federal and local government and locally based private actors from civil society organizations, environmental non-government organizations and local business interest associations, in the state of Quintana Roo, Mexico. The CZ of Quintana Roo is facing pressures from economic development, mainly tourism, with consequences for water pollution and fisheries. Through qualitative, mixed methods, we found that a thick network of private actors has mobilized to play an important role in environmental management and to act in collaboration with the State. Multiple rationales account for this development, including high levels of environmental awareness, particularly with respect to water pollution, while the lack of institutional capacity also motivates state actors to seek partnerships. While private governance is emerging, our data reveal a complex case, where private actor mobilization seeks to promote better regulations, to share data and resources, and to improve implementation capacity within the public administration. Hybrid governance contributes to effective environmental governance of the CZ. However, this can also risk state retreat from its public responsibilities.',\n",

The tourism products offered in social tourism are varied and are aligned with national contexts. Using school-stay as seasonal and low-priced tourist accommodation has long been a unique government-sponsored social tourism scheme in Iran to trigger travelling among disadvantaged and low-income individuals. Against this backdrop, this study sought to critically examine the effects of this long-running policy on the Iranian tourism industry and more particularly on the hospitality sector. Drawing on the documentary research and in-depth interviews with key informants, findings revealed that while such an initiative facilitates travelling among unprivileged and low-income individuals, improves travel spatial distribution, and manages over-crowdedness in peak seasons, it discourages investments in the hospitality sector, negatively affects local economic development and provides inadequate and low-quality hospitality services.

              " 'Dark tourist facilities are a modern tourism phenomenon. Although dark tourism is conceptually associated with the legal inconsistency of tourism, it is based on content related to human suffering. Tourist interest in dark tourist products is growing, and such contents have become a part of standard tourist packages in the markets where such offer exists. Despite their proven contribution to destination differentiation and competitiveness, potential resources for the development of dark tourist facilities are often neglected due to tourist workers lacking the knowledge requisite for the development of specialized tourism products. Unsustainable approach to the development of specialized tourism products results in focus on content, that ignores the broader benefits of an integrated destination product. In the case of dark tourism products, socio-cultural and tantalogic consequences are particularly problematic, as dark tourist offer is particularly sensitive to the ethical standards of the general public. The result is that visitors and organizers of such tourist packages are frequently given negative publicity. In spite of the growing global interest in the dark tourism offer, its development is slow and modest due to the above-mentioned risks and insufficient education in the tourist industry. The existing global supply often ignores some of the potential benefits of implementation of such content into a destinations and national integrated tourism product. In an attempt to clear up doubts, and provide examples of positive and negative experiences from the global tourism practice, the authors carried out several studies based on which they devised a framework model for the development of a dark tourism product with recommended variables of significant impact.',\n",

The tourism projects provide a livelihood strategy to the communities who are involved in the projects. This study makes an attempt to build an understanding of the economic contribution of community-driven tourism projects to sustainable livelihoods. The study draws on a qualitative survey carried out in South Africa's Makuleke contractual Park Community Project. The study utilized the community capital framework (CCF) to examine the community tourism economic capitals' (CTEC) contribution to the community livelihoods. The study also investigated on the ripple effect of the economic capital towards other capitals within the community. Thematic content analysis was used to analyze qualitative data while descriptive statistics were used to analyze the demographic data. Findings indicate that through the Makuleke Contractual Park (MCP) tourism project, the community benefited economically in terms of employment and creation of small & medium tourism related enterprises which provided a livelihood strategy for the community. Through the projects' partnerships with private investors, there was a ripple effect from the economic capital contribution to other community capitals (physical, human, social and natural). Community-driven tourism projects (CDTP) if well managed can transform community capital resources to economic multipliers which can be a livelihood strategy for the community.\",\n",
              " 'This paper emerged from a PhD research project which investigated motivations to tour dark tourism sites, particularly those in South Africa as well as internationally. Like previous studies, the theory that fascination with something dark in tourism, underpinned that research project. Literature showed that the dark valance of dark tourism evolved from ancient morbid spectacles such as public gladiatorial contests, public executions, guided tours of morgues and early Christian pilgrimages. Thus, when the dark tourism discipline emerged (1990s), it was based on the theory of fascination with suffering. However, the results of the motivations to engage in dark tourism study showed that the desire to learn and to pay homage to victims of past atrocities motivated these tours. This refuted the original theory. Thus, follow-up excavation led to the conclusion that neoliberalism was at the bottom of the dark tourism discipline. When neoliberalism became a dominant economic organizing system (1980s), it presented fertile ground for the dark tourism discipline to take root in higher education. Owing to neoliberalism, during the 1990s, higher education institutions experienced state funding cuts, this compelled them to be entrepreneurial to survive. The dark tourism scholarship, consequently, emerged as part of corporatization of higher education.',\n",

The dependent variables in four systems of equations are income, CO2 emission, energy use, and tourism development index. Empirics from difference and system GMM diagnosed the feedback effect between energy use and income; also validated energy push CO2 emission in conjunction with EKC for BRI countries. The results supported bidirectional causality between tourism and income; moreover, tourism push emission hypothesis validated for BRI countries. On the other hand, natural resources are contributing to tourism development, energy use, and CO2 emission in BRI countries. Additionally, natural resources are contributing negatively and significantly to income, thus obeying the natural resource curse phenomenon. So, the allocation of funds on green infrastructure are required to improve the environmental quality and benefit through green tourism. Moreover, the implementation of conservation policies on natural resources can help the GDP growth, environmental quality, and tourism sector on a single platform.',\n",
              " 'Destinations across the globe face severe and potentially irreversible consequences from tourism growth and development. Contemporary approaches such as reducing access or site closures have been identified to increase demand, potentially exacerbating negative impacts. Despite acknowledgement of the impacts of tourism, limited studies have considered the night sky as a tourism destination, nor the implications for regional sustainability. Consequently, the aim of this research is to explore the intersection between Dark sky tourism (DST) and sustainability within regional tourism. Semi-structured interviews were conducted in the Murweh Shire, in outback Australia. The analysis revealed sustainability, ethics and education as critical to achieving sustainable DST in a regional setting. A core contribution of this research is a conceptual model for sustainable DST. Future research is required to further explore ethics as a critical, yet often neglected, component of sustainable tourism.',\n",
              " \"Rural tourism in China is flourishing, largely credited by the scholars in China to the national government's stimulating policies and emphasis on rural regeneration. Against this backdrop and given the scarce literature on the government as a critical stakeholder in rural tourism, this study examines the roles of Chinese central- and local-level governments in rural tourism development. We analyzed both secondary data sourced from government documents and primary data collected through interviews with local government employees and residents at a rural destination in China. The results indicate that the central government plays a steering role in guiding rural tourism towards desired directions, and the local government plays a serving role by directly managing tourism practices and coordinating with businesses and residents to provide services and solve problems. The synergistic interaction of the central and local governments in China stimulates the rapid development of rural tourism.\",\n",

              " 'In India, tourism development has also been used as a strategy for upgrading socioeconomic conditions and living standard of the local people. This study intends to examine the effects of tourism on job and income distribution and also its effects on local peoples livelihood and living standard. The growth of tourism sector in the study area has developed some selected infrastructure and has also generated a lot of employment and income opportunities for the local people and outsiders. This study shows that the high paid jobs and income go to the outsiders, though 34.6% of the owners and employees are from adjacent villages of the study area. Though it is the result of a huge in-migration due to the attraction of jobs and income, one group of local people were found to be engaged in tourism activities only for their subsistence, whereas the other group of people were engaged in high income businesses. This situation creates an intra-village disparity in the study area and adjacent villages. Tourism also seems to positively affect the livelihood and standard of living of the local people. In the study village (Chandipur; Tarapith) where most of the households are directly engaged in tourism-related activities, they are found to spend 35.94% more than the control village (Batail) where none of the households are engaged in tourism-related activities. The expenditure, assets holdings and living condition are also better in the study village compared to the control village. As far as direct economic benefits are concerned, tourism seems to have promoted agricultural production, construction and supply business, craft and manufacturing products, etc. The study observes that lack of human capital among the local people prevents them from drawing the right economic advantage from the enormous growth of tourism in the area.',\n",
              " 'This study develops a scale to measure wine tourism experiences and was tested in Portugal, in two of the main wine tourism centres: Porto and Madeira. The wine experience scale combines experience traits with the traditional approach to scales related to wine tourism. The development of the scale follows the most recognised validated procedures. Data were collected from a total of 647 international wine tourists in the wine cellars of the two main fortified wine tourism regions visiting areas: Porto and Madeira. Structural equation modelling (SEM-AMOS) was used as the main analysis and validation tool. The resulting 18-item wine experience scale comprises four major dimensions: (1) Wine storytelling, (2) wine tasting excitement, (3) wine involvement, and (4) winescape. All these showed reliable and validated indicators. This new scale presents a valid new tool to better measure and evaluate experiences in a wine tourism setting. This study offers a broad range of use for academics, managers, planners, and practitioners. It shows how a new measurement tool focused on the wine tourism experience in terms of several outcomes and applications, addressing important practical managerial implications, can have an impact on academic research. Most previous tourism scales still fail to measure the specifics of wine settings. This is the first scale that comprises the dimensions of experience with wine senses, applied in a relevant wine destination where research is still limited. The results are relevant in boosting the increasingly recognized awareness of Portugal as wine tourism, as well as bringing experience scales to the body of knowledge.',\n",
              " 'In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), in general, and Senegal, in particular, tourism has often been proposed as a pro-poor development strategy due to its intensive use of unskilled labour. However, few studies have examined the linkage between tourism and agriculture, which is still the principal sector for employment in many SSA countries. Using a Structure Path Analysis (SPA), this paper investigates how, in structural terms, an exogenous demand shock on the tourism industry affects the Senegalese agricultural sector. The SPA results show that one of the core sub-sectors of tourism hotels and restaurants has relatively weak linkages with suppliers of agricultural inputs. Staple crops is identified as the agricultural sub-sector that has the most significant impact on tourism. Food and beverage processing plays an indirect but important role in the way hotels and restaurants industry impacts agriculture. Our analysis provides robust evidence that tourism has the capacity to create opportunities for the farmers and local food supply chains through generating additional demand for food products. Policy interventions looking to amplify the benefits that tourism can generate for agriculture, for the case of Senegal and comparable SSA countries, should focus on measures aiming at minimising imports of manufactured food and imports reflecting and affecting food and beverage processing and investing in agritourism development initiatives, such as farm-based accommodation, agricultural festivals and farm-tours.',\n",

              " 'Advances in suborbital, orbital, and beyond orbit space tourism continue to occur at a rapid pace. However, it is uncertain what form this burgeoning industry will take. Some envisage spaceflight as an extension of commercial aviation, a new transport paradigm that would allow flying from London to New York City in less than an hour. Others argue space tourism will remain a niche, high-adrenaline activity suited to adventurers. Finally, space tourism is sometimes instead positioned as more akin to the efforts of explorers, such as early expeditions to Earths polar regions. The level of acceptable risk associated with space tourism hinges on which of these categories defines its development during the coming decades. This paper argues that uncertainty regarding the future course of space tourism development complicates delineating the level of acceptable risk in this domain and that this dynamic is likely to lead to problematic industrial and customer relations.',\n",

This research advances the theoretical foundation and development of natural disaster management through a series of in-depth interviews with the local tourism stakeholders on the investigation of how the role of tourism across the pre-to-post earthquake period is considered by the stakeholders. These local tourism stakeholders have performed or expected a range of actions related to the disaster-management process and contributed to destination resilience. The qualitative analysis discovers, firstly, the multi-functionality of tourism resources, spaces, and industries for disaster preparation; secondly, the evacuation and emergency arrangements during the prodromal and emergency phases; and moreover, more possibilities of restoring the affected destination to a state of long-term (re)development during the post-disaster phases. Information and communication barriers are the major difficulties to be tackled for disaster preparedness. Product creation, image improvement, local knowledge enrichment, and, more importantly, people-to-people and people-to-place connections all contribute to the result of sustainable tourism development. From the destination resilience perspective, collaboration is the key determinant of an improved Hokkaido region. This factor could integrate stakeholders through shared local values, experiences, and memories of disaster risk communication and strategies for preparedness.',\n",

This scenario game set a good example to integrate components of e-Learning, gamification and scenario-based platform in tourism geography and planning education. This study evaluated the effectiveness of urban tourism scenario game in terms of knowledge enrichment, attitudinal change and platform usability reported by a sample of voluntary university students (n = 30). The overall effectiveness of the game is found generally positive. Paired-sampled t-test results show that this game platform is successful in improving participants fundamental knowledge about new concepts, models and issues in the urban tourism context. The nature of tourism study in social science involves dynamism of perception and views, and thus leading to attitudinal changes of the game players although these changes are only statistically significant in one-fourth of the attitudinal attributes. The usability is the shortcomings of the game since this dimension is difficult to control except some technical elements. From the statistical results, the game does not reach a high expectation of usability except the educational design of the game. Some discussions and suggestions are made to enhance the effectiveness of game-based learning in tourism education through clever integration of modes of learning and other e-Learning elements.',\n",

Primary and secondary sources of data were adopted to elicit information for the study. The primary sources involved the use of questionnaire survey, interview sessions and telephone survey while the secondary sources involved the use of documented information on the internet, registry/records of the major hotels and tourist attractions within the study locations. The study revealed that 70% of the entire visitors in 2018 visited tourist attractions within the southern part of the country showing that there were more tourism activities in the Southern part than in the northern part of the country. The study also revealed that tourism attracted benefits such as employment, infrastructural development, provision of basic amenities, increased family income and increased government revenue through tax. Irrespective of the benefits, some challenges such as insecurity, lack of government and private sector interest, indifference in religious and traditional values and poor road network were observed to hinder the growth of the tourism industry. The study also revealed that 72% of visitors to the study locations attended cultural events while the remaining 28% visited natural sites. In view of these findings, the study revealed that the tourism industry in the northern part of the country suffered from some peculiar challenges such as extreme religious and traditional value system which forbids the involvement of women in tourism industry activities and interaction with strangers. With these finding, the study clearly emphasized that economic and cultural diversity had negative impact on the growth of the tourism industry in the northern part of Nigeria.',\n",

The results obtained indicate that the physical education and sports components are leading in all tourism-oriented supplementary programs for children and youth. In terms of physical education and sports programs, the predominance of these components over others is characteristic of all age groups. Programs concerned with tourism, local history, natural science, and social pedagogy give priority to the components of the corresponding specialization, however, at the initial stages (9-11 years and 12-13 years), their health and fitness component remains at the forefront until students have completed their training in tourism techniques and technologies.\",\n",

However, collaboration is a complex and dynamic process, and although there is a growing interest in understanding its mechanisms, much remains unexplored on the matter. The aim of this paper is to operationalise a network approach in analysing characteristics of collaboration in tourism and then to reveal structural weaknesses and strengths from a destination management perspective. The background for analysis is a well-known tourist destination in Romania (Vatra Dornei) that can be considered illustrative for a large spectrum of Eastern European destinations. Methodologically, Social Network Analysis (SNA) techniques were employed, centred on matters related to density and centrality of the tourism network. The results reveal a series of deficiencies inside the network, which have to be addressed by policymakers: (i) a general low level of collaboration; (ii) poor communication between public and private sectors; (iii) a reduced number of central stakeholders but high diversity regarding their fields of activity. The study contributes to the literature by advancing knowledge on particularities of collaboration among tourism stakeholders, while also adding evidence to the utility of SNA in understanding relational dynamics specific to tourism destinations.',\n",

In this article, we attend to the powerful role of beauty labor, norms, and practices in national development. We center the Miss Tourism Uganda beauty pageant, held annually since 2011, and the centerpiece of tourism-based development in Uganda. Designed to attract foreign visitors and investors and to promote a sense of nationalist pride among Ugandans, the pageant-as-development strategy is increasingly mirrored across the neoliberalized Global South. This approach relies on young womens beauty labor: the work of self-improvement via intimate beauty technologies, and the intellectual work of learning and showcasing a beautiful, idealized, national imaginary. This labor is physically, emotionally, and financially demanding, and is largely unremunerated. Yet, it is lucratively exploited to promote local and international corporate brands, generate tourism revenue, and attract foreign investment. Despite this, pageant participants and organizers find creative and collaborative strategies to navigate these demands.

One of the famous dive sites is in the north of Bali, specifically Pemuteran Village. As a result, tourism activities contributed to water shortages in 2009 and 2013, partly because they used up to 65% of the available water supply. This study sought to determine water use and management by the dive resorts in Pemuteran Village and analyze their work connections in supporting tourism business activities, particularly those related to scuba diving. The technical approach used in this research, namely the integration of the mapping and network analysis to measure the water management in the local context, is considered as the appropriate method where the human geographical interview and survey meets with the technical geography of network analysis and mapping. Interviews with dive resort owners and managers in July 2019 produced information on 1) annual water use, 2) efforts and policies related to water use management, and 3) cooperation between dive resorts in Pemuteran Village as an attempt to create sustainable tourism. The results showed that all dive resorts in the village used 30,202,375 liters of water per year and that each of them had internally implemented several strategies to conserve more water. However, based on the technical approach of the Gephi program, the sociogram of the network is currently shown the weak collaboration or agreement between dive resorts on this front, which potentially threatens the sustainability of tourism in Pemuteran Village and affects the income of the local people.',\n",

We examined the development of coal-mining heritage tourism in Sawahlunto, Indonesia, where the mining industry operated for more than a century before it ceased operations in 2001, threatening to push the city into extinction. Sawahlunto has been a distinctly multiethnic community ever since the mining industry attracted workers from various parts of Indonesia. Therefore, the development of mining heritage tourism in Sawahlunto has incorporated aspects of multiethnic cultural tourism, including the creation of various annual festivals. In the process, the cultural identity of local communities has been strengthened, and the common goal of sustaining the city has functioned as a means of social cohesion and integration. Thus, we show that commodification does not always erode the sacredness of a culture but can instead strengthen the cultural identity and social integration of local communities. In Sawahlunto, culture's dual rolesas part of the identity of local communities and as a unique attraction for touristshave been intertwined, thereby influencing, complementing, and strengthening each other.\",\n",

It classifies Mongolia into several regions using the recreation opportunity spectrum and then tests whether Plogs personality types significantly affect the destination choice. Analytical results based on the data of an on-site survey of 406 U.S., South Korean, and Russian tourists recruited at eleven representative destinations present that while the tourists are categorized into psychocentric, midcentric, and allocentric types, allocentric tourists are the largest in number. Also, Plogs personality types are found to differentiate tourist destination choices when socio-demographic and travel-related confounding variables are controlled for. Allocentric tourists are likely to visit primitive areas, whereas psychocentrics tend to visit urban tourist attractions. Accordingly, this study confirms the validity of the recreation opportunity spectrum and Plogs personality types, using the case of Mongolia with unique natural, urban, and tourism settings. Also, tourism service providers and marketers may benefit from the segmentation technique and analytical results suggested in this study in order to assess the needs of their visitors. Highlights This study uses the recreation opportunity spectrum and Plogs model together. The study conducts a survey of inbound tourists in Mongolia. Tourists destination choice can be varied by personality characteristics.',\n",
              " 'Work integrated learning (WIL), in its various forms, continues to be a central element of university tourism programs. Internships, the most common form of WIL, provide opportunities for both personal and professional development. This article presents findings of a content analysis of WIL programs in Australian tourism, hospitality and events (TH&E) undergraduate degrees. Publicly available unit/subject guides were gathered through an internet-based review. This analysis of secondary data identified that the majority of WIL curricula in the Australian university TH&E programs focus on career development, followed by academic achievement and thirdly, personal development. It is argued that the opportunity to facilitate students personal growth and the achievement of advanced learning outcomes through WIL is not being fully realized. Through the lens of self-authorship, meaning in this case, the students use of their internal voice to guide their beliefs, identity and relationships, this paper explores the opportunities for WIL programs to be (re)designed to meet industry needs while also facilitating the individual, personal development of future tourism, hospitality and events leaders.',\n",

Senior tourists encounters with smart services reveal how smart systems influence their travel experiences, tourism participation, and travel-related behaviour. A conceptual framework based on psychological reactance theory is developed in this paper. The factors of perceived threats to freedom when forced to use smart services, perceived constraints to using smart services, psychological reactance, attitudes towards smart services, intentions to use smart services, and intentions to switch from current service provider reflect Chinese senior tourists general aversion to using smart services while travelling and offer valuable managerial implications.',\n",
              " 'Cetacean-Based Tourism (CBT) is often confused with sustainable tourism. However, not every CBT operator has an environmental education component attached to its programme. In reality, CBT has the potential to negatively impact the animals it is targeting; thus management is required to mitigate any harmful effects from tourism activities. This paper analyses the attitudes and perceptions of the marine operators and tourists that partake in dolphin-swim activities in the Ponta do Ouro Partial Marine Reserve (PPMR) in Mozambique. Hand-out questionnaire surveys with closed and Likert scale type questions revealed that the tours are an effective means to promote pro-environmental behaviour and consequently increase compliance with the code of conduct. Nonetheless, in the PPMR, both tourists and operators presented only basic knowledge of the regulations of the reserve and of the dolphin, whale and whale shark code of conduct, indicating that there is a need for improvement. We provide recommendations for improving local management, which are also applicable at the national and international level. Overall, this paper provides knowledge and guidance for moving towards a sustainable based CBT industry in the PPMR.',\n",
              " \"This paper analyses how everyday life, the state and nationhood are regulated and organised in a conflict-affected borderland space through economic activities. It focuses on two elements that are often overlooked when scholars discuss spatial governmentality: tourism and trade. Both are commonly declared to be elements of peace, peacebuilding and cosmopolitism. However, the spatial governance of tourism and trade can also profoundly shape how national belonging and the limits of territory are perceived and experienced by borderland populations and visitors. These dynamics can be acute in conflict-affected border zones, where state sovereignty may be under existential or territorial threat. This paper exposes such dynamics in the Indian conflict borderland area of Ladakh, a part of Jammu and Kashmir State until October 2019. Building on scholarship that has analysed cultural and social dynamics of bordering in the region, this paper argues that it is possible to read (socio-)economic boundary-making in Ladakh through the state's influence in the organisation and experience of trade and tourism for Ladakhis and visitors. The paper highlights how their spatial organisation, in part, underwrites difference and separation, and aids in framing the contested territory as Indian.\",\n",

Such research, however, has failed to acknowledge the fluidity and multiplicity in theorizing gender. To redress this overlook, this study moves away from the conventional binary thinking and views gender as a performativity which is resulted from repetitive social performance. By conducting multiple field observations and interviews with 17 hotel female general managers working in Mainland China and Taiwan, this research presents the ways of doing and undoing gender by tourism female leaders and the extent to which the everlasting gender logic can be questioned.',\n",

The online survey included questions regarding nature protection in the Bieszczady region, factors limiting opportunities for tourism and recreation development in the Bieszczady forests, and the needs regarding new elements of tourism and recreation management of the area. Our research results indicate that the greatest impediments to the recreational use of the forest result from temporary restrictions on forest access, which are related to hunting or forest-management works. Most the interviewed guides were against further development of the tourist and recreational infrastructure in the Bieszczady forests. They were also in favor of extending the nature protection area in Bieszczady. Statistical analyses using the KruskalWallis test showed that persons who are against, in favor of and neutral on extending the nature protection area in the Bieszczady forests varied significantly in their views on issues such as hunting or restrictions on forest access related to forest-management works. Compared to the other respondents, the supporters of extending the range of protected areas were more frequently against designating new recreation spaces or bonfire places in the Bieszczady forests.',\n",
              " \"Post-disaster recovery involves interdependent processes of physical and psychological rehabilitations. Over the past few years, researchers have explored geotagged social media data to assist the planning, monitoring, and assessment of the post-disaster recovery of tourism destinations, given its advantages over traditional approaches. Nonetheless, recent studies have mostly focused on quantitatively accessing the physical elements of post-disaster recovery (e.g., infrastructure reconstruction and re-influx of tourists). Few studies have explored people's sentiments and perspectives over the process of post-disaster recovery. In this study, a mixed methods approach involving sentiment analysis and Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling is designed for mining sheer volume of tweets about Lombok and Bali, generated by nonlocal Twitter users after a series of earthquakes in the two places in August 2018. The findings mainly suggest that people have generally become less negative about Lombok and Bali over time, despite fluctuations in their sentiment polarities' central tendencies. In addition, dissatisfactions about the housing reconstruction progress, tourism recovery status, and living conditions in the affected areas of Lombok still existed in 2019; contestations have been found with regard to the huge funds for hosting the 2018 Bali IMF-World Bank meeting after the earthquakes. The overall results of this study have proved that the adopted approach can effectively reveal the variations of people's sentiments and perspectives of general and specific issues regarding post-disaster tourism recovery over time.\",\n",

The purpose of this study is to explore the pull and push factors in heritage tourism. This study generated 38 initial items of pull factor and 18 initial items of push factor toward heritage tourism to assess the significance of items influencing people's decision to visit heritage sites. The study obtained 332 valid questionnaires to implement exploratory factor analysis to capture the pull and push factors. Four pull factors with 15 items and 2 push factors with 9 items were extracted. The pull factors consisted of heritage architecture, art activity, wide nature, and regional attraction, while the push factors comprised recreational benefits and long-term values. The study suggests that the heritage's outdoor environment should be planned through wide landscaping and natural elements, while art activities can be promoted to enhance attractiveness.\",\n",

A comprehensive understanding of racism is beneficial to activist groups, policymakers and governments. Traditional approaches, such as surveys and interviews, are usually time-consuming and inefficient in capturing the occurrence of large-scale racism. In this study, we utilise routinely collected data available on tourism websites to assess self-reported racism in the tourism domain. We present a data acquisition procedure that collects racism-related reviews from the Internet at the global scale and then utilise statistics and natural language processing techniques to analyse and explore racism in terms of its tendency, distribution, semantics and characteristics. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a case study, in which we acquire racism-related data at the global scale and validate the impact of racial discrimination on tourists experience.',\n",

The towns interested in applying had to have heritage assets, be these historical, cultural or natural. After 17 years of operation of the Pueblos Mgicos program, this work analyzes their development and evolution on three scales: first, the way the program has spread geographically throughout the country. Following on from this, the State of Michoacn is analyzed, since it has 8 Pueblos Magicos (PM), where Ptzcuaro, one of these, is chosen as a representative case study, in order to identify whether the urban improvements seen in the municipality come from this being a Pueblo Magico . The results show that the program has included 121 towns located in 31 states, focusing mainly on a central strip of the country, showing a mismatch between the original goals of the program and its current situation. Using the increased tourist activity in Patzcuaro, the authors identify that urban improvement actions and plans focus their work on the Historical Monuments Zone (HMZ), and around the lake. The attention given by the city and its efforts to maintain an urban image in the HMZ, along with a tourist approach, may result in a lack of attention paid to infrastructure deficiencies that have appeared and not been resolved in neighborhoods and districts within the municipality.',\n",
              " 'In the past decades, the Caribbean economy has transformed to rely primarily on tourism with a vast amount of infrastructure dedicated to this sector. At the same time, the region is subject to repeated crises in the form of extreme weather events that are becoming more frequent, deadly, and costly. Damages to buildings and infrastructure (or the material stocks) from storms disrupt the local economy by an immediate decline in tourists and loss of critical services. In Antigua and Barbuda (A&B), tourism contributes 80% to the GDP and is a major driver for adding new material stocks to support the industry. This research analyzes A&Bs material stocks (MSs) in buildings (aggregates, timber, concrete, and steel) using geographic information systems (GIS) with physical parameters such as building size and footprint, material intensity, and the number of floors. In 2004, the total MSs of buildings was estimated at 4.7 million tonnes (mt), equivalent to 58.5 tonnes per capita, with the share of non-metallic minerals to be highest (2.9 mt), followed by aggregates (1.2 mt), steel (0.44 mt), and timber (0.18 mt). Under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations (NOAAs) 2 meter (m) sea level rise scenario, an estimated 4% of the islands total MSs would be exposed. The tourism sector would disproportionately experience the greatest exposure of 19% of its MSs. By linking stocks to services, our research contributes to the understanding of the complexities between the environmental and economic vulnerability of island systems, and the need for better infrastructure planning as part of resilience building.',\n",

The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of data-based value co-creation under varying conditions of consumer control and benefits. Academic and press articles were used to explore the nature of big data value co-creation in a wide range of hospitality, tourism, and other industries. A forward-looking approach was adopted by considering the implications of policy and technology as key mechanisms for sharing the power dynamic regarding the ownership, control and use of personal data. The results suggest that reciprocal big data value creation can be seen as a function of the level of benefit and control afforded to consumers regarding the use of their data. Four types of reciprocal big data value creation are proposed.',\n",

Through a focus group and a questionnaire survey targeting Italian millennial students (n= 2292), we first identified the main motivations that drive this choice. Second, we identified the level of importance for each motivation during both seasons. The findings revealed that millennials are guided by six main motivations in choosing mountain areas as travel destinations, each of which play different roles according to the considered season. The only exception is represented by the category of food and beverage, which is not influenced by seasonality. The results contribute to the literature on tourism and millennials, giving insight on the motivations that drive millennials choices. Moreover, the results are relevant from a managerial point of view by providing important indications to managers and policy makers on the determinants of millennials decisions.',\n",

The implications for industries related to the Olympics-tourism, hotels and restaurants, and others-are expected to be affected by reduced demand. Japanese workers in these industries were prepared to offer their hospitality to visitors from around the world. They would be benefited not only by an increase in income but also in offering visitors a taste of Tokyo's great hospitality if the Olympics had been held in 2020. However, postponement of the sporting event is likely to have a significant impact on their happiness level. We independently collected individual-level panel data from March to April 2020. In the survey, the respondents were asked about their happiness levels by choosing from 11 categories: 1 (very unhappy) and 11 (very happy). They were also asked about expected income changes from 2020 to 2021. Based on this, we examined the effect of postponement on happiness level and expected income change. The sample was divided into sub-samples of areas including and excluding Tokyo. We found that the happiness level of workers in the tourism and restaurant sectors declined drastically after the announcement of the postponement. Only two weeks later, their happiness level did not alter from the pre-announcement level. This tendency was strongly observed in Tokyo and the surrounding prefectures, but not in other prefectures. However, workers engaged in the tourism and restaurant sectors did not predict a decrease in their income even after the postponement. Combined, these findings indicate that loss of extending hospitality, rather than reduction in income, temporarily reduces the happiness level of workers.\",\n",

Negative impacts associated with these influxes include mortality of nearshore benthic flora and fauna, beach erosion, pollution, decreasing tourism and high management costs. To understand the dynamics of the sargasso influx, we used Landsat 8 imagery (from 2016 to mid-2020) to record the coverage of sargasso in the sea off the Mexican Caribbean coastline, with a maximum reported in September 2018. Satellite image analysis also showed local differences in the quantity of beached sargasso along the coastline. Over the years, good practice for collection on the beach and for off-shore collection of sargasso have been established through trial and error, and the Mexican Government and hotel industry have spent millions of dollars on removal and off-shore detention of sargasso. Notwithstanding, sargasso also has various properties that could be harnessed in local industries. The stimulation of local industrial growth would offer alternatives to the dependence on tourism, as a circular economy, based on sargasso, is developed.',\n",

A strong earthquake in Kumamoto and Oita prefectures in the Kyushu region occurred in April 2016. Some tourist destinations closed and cancellations by a large number of travelers (both domestic and inbound) had a significant impact on the tourism industry. This paper explains a methodology to evaluate the impact of earthquake disasters on the Kyushu regions inbound tourism economy. An IRIO table is estimated with 15 sectors and 245 municipalities and is used to calculate the output and spillover effects on seven prefectures, the capital cities, and several sightseeing cities in the Kyushu region. The inbound regional demand and backward linkage output are evaluated at monthly level after the earthquake. The findings show that Fukuoka prefecture has the highest spillover effect values totally, followed by Oita and Nagasaki prefectures. Furthermore, the highest spillover in the capital city was in Fukuoka, followed by Nagasaki, and Kagoshima. Regarding sightseeing cities, Beppu has higher spillover effects value, followed by Yufu, and Kitakyushu. Within a short period of time, the net effect of the monthly level indicates that the economic damage in Kumamoto and Beppu cities is widespread. However, the economic benefit in Fukuoka city implies less spillover effects. The results suggest that regional economic effects should be assessed at the recovery stage after a disaster based on short- and long-term aspects.',\n",

Based on a case study carried out in the Brko District of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Brko District), a model will be developed to test for rural tourism destination attractiveness. Examination of tourist destination attractiveness in the area of the Brko District was conducted with a decision model based on the Decision EXpert method and expert decision-making. For that purpose, six rural settlements in the area of the Brko District were examined with respect to destination attractiveness. Results obtained using this model showed that rural settlement Bijela has a very good attractiveness, rural settlements Brezik, Brezovo Polje, and Gornji Zovik have good attractiveness, while rural settlements Raljevo and Maoa have middle attractiveness. The results obtained by applying this model have shown the need for improvement of touristic offer in order to make it more attractive. In order to improve attractiveness of a tourist destination, we need to strengthen human potential in this area and improve tourist infrastructure and make more effort to preserve the environment. The application of the used model has given good results in examination of tourist destination attractiveness and it should be applied for other branches of tourism in the future studies.',\n",

Over the past 25 years, Ghana has been a major site for diasporic homecoming, both in terms of tourism and repatriation. This movement has been accompanied by multiple demands and promises of citizenship. I discuss three dimensions of citizenship that speak to the problematics of inclusion and exclusion in the rhetoric and practice of diasporic homecoming. First, there is citizenship as an affective claim to belonging; second, there is citizenship as a legal status (and obligation); and third, there is the renegotiation of citizenship through genetic ancestry.

The findings reflect the significance of consumer feedback metrics on the economy as a whole; therefore, efforts to boost consumer feedback metrics should consider a national agenda.',\n",
              " 'This study focuses on Chinese millennials as a unique travel group and investigates how the usage of mobile technology impacts their leisure travel experience and continuous engagement with mobile technology. The study results demonstrate that, among the three major mobile technology functions, the utilitarian and social functions have significant positive impacts on Chinese millennials leisure travel experience, whereas the hedonic function does not extend any significant influences. In addition, leisure travel experience partially mediates the relationship between the utilitarian function of mobile technology and Chinese millennials future mobile technology engagement. The findings provide insights for tourism practitioners regarding how to efficiently develop mobile applications through emphasizing utilitarian and social functions to better meet Chinese millennials needs. The function-improved mobile apps can enhance their leisure travel experience and further contribute to the continuous mobile technology engagement. A virtuous circle will be generated between the mobile technology engagement and leisure travel experience.',\n",
              " 'Although the cruise sector is considered an unreplaceable form of tourism, with the cruise industry recording steady growth over the years, there is a lack of research and analysis on cruise ships themselves. Accordingly, this study sought to determine whether service quality differences among ships operating in the Asian market could suggest broader implications for the sustainability of the cruise industry. We chose the SERVQUAL framework for the analysis; we also employed the multiple case study method and topic synthesis to compare the service quality of three ships. Of the ships investigatedthe Costa Victoria, Diamond Princess, and Superstar Virgothe Diamond Princess had the highest service quality. Based on the results, we outlined suggestions for improving the quality of cruise services, including introducing the latest large ships and high-tech facilities, complying with the departure and arrival times of sailing schedules, improving the ratio of crew members per passenger, establishing a cruise personnel training system, and expanding membership program operations.',\n",

Inside the catchment region of these centres, on the continuum: higher settlement centre  periphery, the zone of the remote peripheral municipalities, and zone of semi-peripheral and suburban municipalities can be distinguished. The human capital of municipalities in these zones is evaluated and compared subsequently in the article. This is necessary because the low human capital of peripheral municipalities is often due to their remoteness. In addition, the remoteness and low level of human capital require different mitigating and stimulating instruments and measures. The assumption of low level of human capital in peripheral municipalities can only be partially confirmed  only one third of the peripheral municipalities in South Bohemia report significantly unfavourable values of human capital indicators. The level of the human capital in some peripheral municipalities improves thanks to tourism, counter-urbanization, quality municipality management and government instruments and measures specified in the article.',\n",
              " 'Job satisfaction is a key concept in the organizational literature, as satisfied employees allow organizations to achieve desired work-related outcomes. Nevertheless, more research is needed to understand what organizational and individual variables shape the job satisfaction of employees from the hospitality sector. This study assesses the role of organizational variables (perceived organizational support and organizational health) and individual variables (positive psychological capital and creative personality) as possible determinants of job satisfaction. A total of 504 hotel employees from the Algarve region, the main Portuguese tourism destination, participated in this study. Structural equation modeling with latent variables was used to evaluate the proposed model. Results showed that perceived organizational support was the most important predictor of job satisfaction, followed by organizational health. Organizational health also predicted positive psychological capital, which, in turn, was significantly associated with job satisfaction. These results have important practical implications for human resources management in the hospitality industry.',\n",
              " 'The treatment of endogenous inputs and outputs in the estimation of multipleoutput distance functions is an important issue that has been largely ignored in the hotel and tourism literature. It is well known that directional distance functions with endogeneity are difficult to estimate using maximum likelihood-based methods since the specification of additional identifiable equations for each endogenous variable is highly challenging. In this paper, we propose a limited-information approach to models of this type using a flexible reduced form for the endogenous variables. This approach allows us to easily estimate technical efficiency and does not rely on information about input or output prices, which are typically unavailable. We employ Bayesian methods and propose and use novel posterior measures of weakness and relevance of instruments in an application involving data from major US hotels. We show that controlling for endogeneity has a substantial impact for relative and absolute hotel performance.',\n",
              " 'This study explores the underlying motivating factors of Emiratis and Indian expatriates to visit destinations featured in movies. The results revealed a five-factor structure for Indians: novelty, fantasy-driven, personal connection, prestige and movie connection, vis--vis a three-factor structure for Emiratis: novelty, fantasy-driven and personal connection with the movie location. An analyses of variance analysis (ANOVA) showed significant differences in the individual mean scores of items, with the exception of novelty. Regarding gender, while no significant differences were found between the male and female Indian expatriate populations across all factors and underlying items, differences for some items were observed between male and female Emiratis, with male participants demonstrating higher motivation than female participants. These findings support the notion that the underlying factors influencing movie-induced tourism differ between cultures, while the influence of gender was found to be limited. Overall, the study enhances the understanding of practitioners and policymakers tasked with attracting tourists to movie destinations.',\n",
              " 'Food security is usually identified as a desirable outcome depending on a variety of factors such as food availability, access and distribution. Food self-sufficiency is one of the key factors when it comes to evaluating food availability. Furthermore, food self-sufficiency is not only a national concern but also relevant on a sub-national scale. A consumption-oriented approach is proposed to measure the degree of self-sufficiency on a regional scale. In our proposal, exports are subtracted from domestic supply to assess the share of domestic production in domestic consumption. By doing so, the effects of regional specialization in export crops on our estimates are avoided. Due to its increasing relevance in consumption patterns, the food industry is included as a separate group of food items. Owing to their small size, high density of human activities, specialization in tourism, and remoteness from the European continent, the Canary Islands are an interesting laboratory for illustrating the advantages and shortcomings of measuring food self-sufficiency on a local scale.',\n",
              " \"This paper analyzes the configuration of political power in Salvador and its links with the urban development of the city. It seeks to understand the intergovernmental relations between the municipal government and the state government and its relations with the coalition of private interests of the so-called capitals of the urban. The article starts from the city's metropolization process in the 1970s and reaches contemporary transformations that, since the 1990s, have characterized Salvador as a city focused on urban entrepreneurship that focuses on tourism, real estate production and carrying out recreational and cultural activities. The work was based on bibliographic research and on the collection of information in documents, management reports, newspapers and magazines, government advertisements and speeches by managers. The results illustrate the dilemmas of a poor and peripheral city whose urban development process was linked to the interests of several urban capitals and a regional political elite. Currently, the urban management of the municipality has been the subject of intergovernmental competition between the municipal and state public authorities, which, although from different political-party coalitions, operate within similar logic of intervention, based on a broad entrepreneurial program of urban management.\",\n",
              " \"Cruise tourism is an obviously global industry in different dimensions. From a geographical perspective, cruise ships are mobile and capable of being repositioned at a company's notice, which forms the inherent basis for its global spatial layout. As a branch of the cruise industry, the world cruise is clearly globalizing in geographical space by offering long itinerary, even round-the-world trips, for everyone. Using the schedule data from 2018 to 2019, this paper analyzes the spatial characteristics of the itinerary and port organization of Cunard, a world cruise company. We find that the itinerary distribution and port organization of Cunard are both globalization and regionalization, and the latter is the core and main component of the former. Under the influence of the COVID-19 epidemic, the global mobility of cruises has ground to a halt, while local mobility offers the possibility of its resumption as soon as possible. Turning to the regional voyage with the shorter and simple itinerary is feasible for Cunard and other world cruises, which is conducive to the realization of the resuming voyage as soon as possible. Moreover, strict boarding and safety onboard are essential.\",\n",
              " 'Security policy has a direct impact on regional development, which especially concerns border areas of countries. It can be an instrument of economic development or can lead to regression. Greater mobility is beneficial to local communities. However, this is not always a priority for central authorities who tend to shape policies, including the security one, in a comprehensive manner, without taking into account the specificities of life in border areas. This policy may also undergo a pendulum-like evolution, for example, from restrictions through openness to renewed restrictions. An example of this is the functioning of local border traffic on the Polish-Russian border, which was implemented during the years 20122016 and contributed to the development of shopping tourism and economic stimulation of the areas on both sides of the border by increasing the purchase rate of goods and services. The suspension of local border traffic by Poland for an indefinite time was justified by security issues. Nevertheless, local communities pointed to the lack of legitimacy of this action and the economic losses, demanding the restoration of LBT on the Polish-Russian border. ; 2020 RSAI',\n",
              " 'Document co-citation analysis (DCA) is employed across various academic disciplines and contexts to characterise the structure of knowledge. Since the introduction of the method for DCA by Small (J Am Soc Inf Sci 24(4):265269, 1973) a variety of modifications towards optimising its results have been proposed by several researchers. We recommend a new approach to improve the results of DCA by integrating the concept of the document similarity measure into it. Our proposed method modifies DCA by incorporating the semantic similarity using latent semantic analysis for the abstracts of the top-cited documents. The interaction of these two measures results in a new measure that we call as the semantic similarity adjusted co-citation index. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated through an empirical study of the tourism supply chain (TSC), where we employ the techniques of the network and cluster analyses. The study also comprehensively explores the resulting knowledge structures from both the methods. The results of our case study suggest that the clustering quality and knowledge map of the domain can be improved by considering the document similarity along with their co-citation strength.',\n",
              " 'The present study discusses the strategic role of gastronomy in destinations from the perspective of three theoretical foundations of strategic management, namely Resource-Based View (RBV), Emergent Strategy (ES), and Positioning Strategy (PS). Several concepts from the field of gastronomy are used, such as gastronomic identity, tourist behaviours (motivation, experience, consumption), a sense of place, and food image. Utilizing this multi-disciplinary literature, the present study provides an integrative review and develops a model explaining the strategic role of gastronomy in tourism destinations consisting of three main components (the source, process, and form of a strategy). According to the suggested model, gastronomic identity is considered a strategic resource for destinations. Depending on the gastronomic identity, a differentiation strategy can be formed in a destination that involves the presentation of gastronomic products developed and offered by discoverers (entrepreneurs, researchers, and tourists) to the relevant markets. This strategy is the result of an emergent, rather than deliberate, strategic process. However, when destination managers and stakeholders realize that a gastronomy-based strategy has emerged, such a strategy can also be transformed into a deliberate strategy. The predictions of the model are supported by the conceptual and empirical findings of earlier studies.',\n",

Taking Chongqing municipality as the case study, this paper selects appropriate indicators in the perspective of time and space, and utilizes the coupling coordination evaluation models (CCD) and GIS spatial methods to analyze the correlation degree, coupling degree and coordination degree. The results show that: (1) the Economic urbanization (0.37) and Greening ecological level (0.28) make the largest share of contribution to the system of urbanization and Geo-ecological environment, respectively. From 1990 to 2015, the coupling coordination in Chongqing has shown a continuous growth trend, and has transitioned to moderate and favorable coupling coordination from disorder. (2) The coupling coordination in 2015 has undergone significant regional differences. The coupling coordination in more developed areas (western Chongqing) was generally higher than in less developed areas (northeastern and southeastern Chongqing).

This article fills a gap in the literature by developing a model to explain modifications which occur many years after the event. Such modifications, beyond the financial means of most individual families, are unexpected given that the lack of need to reinterpret the event, as often occurs with modifications to memorials which may have a wider social significance. The article develops a model using existing literature on transportation accident memorials, memory studies and death studies, pointing to the need for three factors: local approval, co-ordination (of both people and funds), and a trigger. In relation to the trigger, the model finds that this relates to the continuation of the bereavement process as well as potentially issues relating to dark tourism. Having developed the model, it is tested against the case study of a modification made to a memorial for the worlds largest single-plane crash, JAL flight JL123. The article finds, in addition to the model working for this case, there is a need for bereavement theory to be better used within studies on memorialisation.',\n",

However, most studies focus on physical accessibility, and only a few analyse the attitudes of students and professionals in this sector towards people with disabilities (PwD). This review aims to analyse the work carried out in other scientific areas on attitudes towards PwD. It is intended to map methodologies, measurement instruments and main variables and factors related with attitudes, to promote their inclusion in society. Research was carried out at Scopus and 492 records were obtained. Of these, 96 articles were selected for analysis. Results show that the assessment of attitudes towards PwD is a topic of great relevance in several scientific areas. Studies use several instruments to measure these attitudes. Previous experiences, quality, and frequency of contact with PwD and knowledge about disability have an influence on attitudes. However, results differ in the influence of the sociodemographic profile on attitudes towards PwD. There is a trend towards the use of quantitative methodologies, using the questionnaire as a tool for data collection. The article ends by identifying areas of research relevant to the increasing knowledge of the factors that influence these attitudes and, consequently, to the development of AT.',\n",

While the devastation of the reactor is often regarded as a dark metonym for the fate of the Soviet Union (Milne 2017: 95), the nuclear crisis is also at the centre of increasing anxieties about the fate of future generations, species extinction and the damage done to the environment (93). Indeed, the enormity of Chernobyl, like Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Fukushima, is often regarded as beyond representation. By examining a range of poems produced by Chernobylites or derived from witness testimonies, we argue that in confronting the unthinkable, poetry is uniquely able to convey the inexpressible and abject horror of nuclear destruction. Further, in considering the potential for commodification in writing about sites of tragedy, we define poetry about the Chernobyl nuclear disaster as an example of dark poetry  that is, poetry exploring or attempting to imagine or reanimate examples of dark tourism. We specifically explore this example of dark poetry to contend that while it often lobbies for nuclear international cooperation, it can also be read as exploitative and romanticising the macabre spectacle of nuclear explosion.',\n",

Viticulture and its complementary branches are differently developed in different parts of the world  the predisposition of further development, however, is also influenced importantly by positions of different identification referential groups which they have towards the use of wine and further development of the profession. Based on the research of standpoints of the mayors in the Republic of Slovenia, which could be presented as wine-growing country with regards to the extent of the vine, we can assert that mayors with their relationship towards wine and their operations influence the use of local wine for the tourist promotion of destination importantly. According to that, we figure out that mayors play an important role in the development of public policy in the local environment.

The aim of this study to determine which factors influence the future intentions of the tourist involved in small-scale sports events. The sample was composed of 236 subjects who participated in a half-marathon in Spain. The results of the Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) provide support for the applicability of the tourists' perception questionnaire in the context of sports events. The results of both validity (convergent and discriminant) and reliability (internal consistency) analyses were satisfactory. The results indicated that this scale had 18 items distributed in six factors (communication, staff, electronic wordofmouth, destination image, satisfaction and future intentions). The proposal model revealed that satisfaction is a mediated factor between staff and destination image with future intentions of repeating the event. Electronic word of mouth and satisfaction were influencing factors that predicted the tourists' future intentions. This finding suggests that this questionnaire can be a useful tool in measuring tourist perception on a small-scale sports events scale, allowing a better understanding of the reasons that lead a tourist to select a certain destination and sports event.\",\n",

While the world was hit by the pandemic as early as January 2020, South Africa recorded its first case on 5 March 2020. A five-stage lockdown was introduced to flatten the curve and prepare the heath system during the first level. Lockdown regulations were severe, with restricted movement only for essential services. The extreme lockdown measures had a visible impact on the leisure and tourism industry. Small businesses were devastated by the financial hardship and job losses have contributed to the already high level of unemployment and social-economic inequalities among citizens. Observations for this study were based on what people shared on social and popular media, including discussions with friends and family. The pandemic forced many people to revisit how they live, work and play. People change and adapt their leisure pursuits to fit the situation they find themselves in. Technology was embraced to connect with others and to pursue leisure activities. The future of leisure and recreation practices post-COVID-19 is not clear and will change indefinitely.

              " 'With Airbnb becoming an important issue in both tourism and public policy, scholarly research on Airbnb has increased over the past several years. The role of Airbnb varies according to the features and expectations of the host territory. It can either be considered as a complement to an underdeveloped supply of tourist accommodation or as a potential competitor to traditional accommodation that has to be regulated. Although most of the research has been carried out in big cities, Airbnb activity is also present in smaller towns, resorts, rural and mountain areas. This article aims to analyse the Airbnb spatial distribution in a mountain destination (Andorra). Specifically, it is aimed at exploring whether there is a spatial correlation regarding the location of traditional accommodation. Clustering techniques are used to determine natural groups of urban settlements on the basis of the number of Airbnb listings and different types of traditional accommodation. The results pinpoint where Airbnb is concentrating its accommodation offer, as well as where both Airbnb listings and traditional accommodation are clustered. Our research sheds light on the distribution patterns of Airbnb in mountain areas and deepens knowledge on the influences of public policy strategies aimed at regulating the Airbnb phenomena.',\n",

We analyzed how different social actors perceived changes in ecosystem services (ESs) and benefits from marine conservation and explored barriers preventing access to benefits, based on the Marine Protected Area of Multiple Uses (MUMPA) Almirantazgo Sound located in the Chilean Patagonia. We applied a semi-structured interview to artisanal fishers, tourism operators, State representatives and researchers (n = 86) and analyzed the data through frequency analysis and Covariance Analysis. Interviewees identified various ESs but prioritized food provision, maintenance of genetic diversity, and information for cognitive development, and among several benefits, they prioritized basic materials for a good life. Fishers were the most dependent on ESs and benefits, (i.e., food provision and employment/nutrition, respectively). Social actors general perception was that the MUMPA will not change wellbeing homogeneously, which can be explained by specific access barriers, such as reduced fishing entree. Most interviewees, despite personal attributes, recognized tour operators as the main winners of the MUMPA creation and fishers as the main losers. For an inclusive governance, managers face the challenge of reshaping the disparate images actors have on what the MUMPA is and does.',\n",

In this paper we demonstrate how spatial modelling co-produced with managers can support the assessment of interactions between two cultural services: outdoor recreation and iconic terrestrial vertebrates. In two French national parks (Ecrins and Vanoise) we showed clear seasonal differentiation in spatial patterns for potential iconic vertebrate diversity, recreation opportunities and their interactions. Our first hypothesis that limited access and mobility of recreationists during winter would increase potential wildlife refugia was largely validated for Ecrins. Our second hypothesis that lower but spatially diffuse pressure from recreationists in Ecrins would increase potential interference as compared to more intense but directed activity in Vanoise was consistent with patterns in summer. For winter the spatial concentration of recreation around ski resorts of Vanoise was highly impactful. Across both parks concerns about the expansion of winter activities are legitimate, especially for climate-sensitive species. We also showed the critical role of refuge areas in high valleys (summer) and lower slopes away from tracks (winter), highlighting threats from off-track practices. Beyond regulation our results will support dialogue with the public and professionals based on communication and education.',\n",

However, few approaches can investigate relationships of multiple CESs in a spatially explicit way and involve different groups of stakeholders. In our study, we developed an integrated approach that combined a survey-driven model (SolVES) and a text analysis of the social media reviews, using the Guanting Reservoir basin as an example. Three CESs, including aesthetic service, historical and cultural service, and recreational and therapeutic service, were examined. The results showed that 80% of the total area of the basin exhibited a spatial mismatch between CES supply and demand. Among the three CESs, historical and cultural service had the largest mismatched area, which was dominated by a low supply and high demand. For the venue of the 2022 Winter Olympics, Chongli District, all three CESs exhibited spatial mismatches, while the main type of mismatch was low supply and high demand. Urbanization can either promote a match or worsen a mismatch. Therefore, place-based solutions, such as environmental monitoring and promoting tourism, are encouraged to mitigate the mismatch of CES supply and demand in rapidly urbanizing watersheds.',\n",

The traditional gravity model implies the hypothesis of equilibrium points without any reference to when or how to achieve it. In this paper, a dynamic gravity model was established based on the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) theory to estimate and monitor the interconnection intensity and dynamic characters of bilateral relations. In order to detect the determinants of interconnection intensity, a Geodetector method was applied to identify and evaluate the determinants of spatial networks in five dimensions. The empirical study clearly demonstrates a heterogeneous and non-circular spatial structure. The main driving forces of spatial-temporal evolution are foreign direct investment, tourism and railway infrastructure construction, while determinants in different sub-regions show obvious spatial differentiation. Southeast Asian countries are typically multi-island area where aviation infrastructure plays a more important role. North and Central Asian countries regard oil as a pillar industry where power and port facilities have a greater impact on the interconnection.

These new features, however, have not been specifically investigated, especially in a considerably potential tourist destination like Iran. This study sought to develop a model for identifying and prioritizing the indicators that could determine the ecological features of hotels. Following a systematic review, exploratory factor analysis and analytic network process were used to construct a hybrid model and its elements were then prioritized in five-star hotels in the Fars province, Iran. The model consisted of five dimensions (totally including 19 indicators), namely energy, ecological adaptation, materials and equipment, foods and drinks, and cultural-economic activities. The findings revealed that the energy dimension was significantly important, while indicators such as effective use of water, supply and efficient use of energy, and use of renewable energies were the most important indicators, respectively. The results of this study can encourage managers/practitioners in hotel accommodation to concentrate on the indicators that could promote the ecological level of hotels. In doing so, they can consider energy, foods, and beverage indicators in developing green hotels and implement appropriate accommodation with ecotourism standards to attract (inter)national tourists.',\n",
              " \"Both E. M. Forster's A Room with a View (1908) and Charles Dickens's Little Dorrit (1855-1857) satirize British guidebook users, depicting them as mindless followers rather than as individual explorers of foreign landscapes. Series by John Murray and Baedeker dominated the landscape of Victorian travel, and scholars have pointed out that while mainstream guidebooks made foreign tourism more accessible for the middle class, they also presented travel as a heavily prescriptive and systematic endeavour, one that often sheltered British travellers from an encounter with foreignness. This article extends our understanding of the Victorian guidebook's legacy by examining three Anglo-American guidebooks for women travelling to Paris-Mary Abbot's A Woman's Paris (1900), Elizabeth Otis Williams' Sojourning, Shopping, and Studying in Paris (1907), and Alice M. Ivimy's A Woman's Guide to Paris (1909). It suggests that these fin-de-sicle women's guidebooks emerged as a critique both of mainstream guidebooks' prescriptive approach to foreign travel and of the narrow interests to which they catered. This article shows how, in actively resisting the genre's emphasis on uniformity and expediency, guidebooks for women instead privileged spontaneous discovery, personal interest, and an encounter with the Parisian culture and landscape. In doing so, it seeks to reformulate our understanding of women's travel narratives and of the cultural legacy of Victorian guidebooks.\",\n",
              " 'This paper analyses the price responses of airports to a demand collapse, such as that prompted by Covid-19. In the crisis, airports need to achieve viability, in the short run through sufficient liquidity, and in the long run, by covering costs. From a public policy viewpoint, price increases in a crisis are argued to be undesirable, as they would further jeopardise the viability of airlines and tourism as well as the wider economic transport benefits such as connectivity. The institutional environment of airports differs from airport to airport; some are publicly owned, others are private but regulated, and others face competition. The price response of each (of 6) types of airport is considered, and how policy could respond to keep prices low in the crisis while ensuring longer term viability. Regulated airports could defer price increases until demand had recovered, if regulators insisted they do so. Publicly-owned airports could be directed by governments to keep charges low. Governments might also state that unregulated airports that raised charges could be made subject to price regulation in the future. Competitive airports would be unable to raise charges but this could jeopardise their viability. In this case and others where airports might need financial assistance, assistance could be made conditional on keeping charges low in the crisis.',\n",
              " 'This paper assesses government support measures to the air transport sector following the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic from two points of view. First, it explores the factors that shape governments willingness to support airlines. This is followed by a discussion on the various types of support that may be provided and how country-specific parameters influence the choice of measures. Second, it analyses the implications of government support in three dimensions relevant to air transport policy: competition and liberalisation, airline ownership and control, and environmental sustainability. The analysis suggests that most governments give a high priority to maintaining air transport connectivity in order to protect economic activity and jobs, in aviation itself and in related sectors such as tourism. The trade-off between ensuring connectivity and maintaining competition after the COVID-19 pandemic is a challenge with several political and economic dimensions. The re-orientation of public policy in the aftermath of the pandemic may limit the relative importance of the policy priorities that shaped the evolution of the air transport sector before the crisis, especially those related to climate change and the environment. The role of government and public authorities at all levels  especially the type and duration of measures affecting transport operations  will be crucial for the future development of the aviation industry.',\n",

Beyond these virtual agents professional expertise, they must have a social dimension to build long-term relationships with users. Interpersonal intimacy is at the core of the most gratifying social exchanges, and we claim that it could constitute a remarkable means to reinforce the social dimension of ECAs. This paper presents an experimental study that compares the perception of intimacy in human and human-agent interactions. Are nature and social expressiveness critical factors for the perception of intimacy? To answer this question, we created two corpora of videos showing a human or a virtual tourism information (TI) counselor using or not using intimate behaviors in the course of an interaction with a human tourist. Using the Virtual Intimacy Scale (VIS) designed in previous work, we asked observers to judge the intimacy level of the TI counselor during the interaction. We demonstrate that intimate behaviors expressed by the virtual counselor and the human counselor are equally perceived by participants, which supposes a common model of intimacy for human and human-agent dyads. Participants perceive the human counselor less intimate than the virtual counselor when having non intimate behaviors. We posit that humans and agents elicit different expectations regarding social abilities, which directly affect their perceived level of intimacy. Our work raises questions regarding the expression of social behaviors and questions social representations.',\n",

The fulfillment of these norms is becoming increasingly important, especially for passenger ships used for tourist excursions. Recently, the development of maritime tourism has greatly increased the demand for these ships most of which are converted fishing vessels. The situation described in this paper pertains to Albania and most probably differs in other countries in the region and the wider area. Ships rarely have adequate technical documentation. The Albanian Register of Shipping requires the performance of stability tests, the results of which are entered in the amended stability book to ensure the vessels compliance with the norms following modifications undergone and guarantee safe navigation for tourists. An examination of a variety of ship design papers helped us identify various methods and methodologies for determining approximate geometric ship elements with an acceptable degree of reliability. However, their use should be limited and reliability proven by calculating parameters such as lightship VCG, number of passengers per m2, assessing the possible range and area of navigation and weather conditions (mainly wind speed and wave forces). The calculations based on stability testing and the use of highly reliable software such as MaxSurf - Integrated Naval Architecture Software, Napa - Naval Architectural Package, Autoship - Systems Operation, Orca3D  Naval Architecture Software delivered fast and reliable stability assessment results and verified conformance with the norms prescribed by the Albanian Register of Shipping.',\n",
              " \"The service sector provides employment for more than 70% of the active population in developed countries, in areas as varied as tourism, commerce, logistics, finances, services, and personnel, amongst others. Despite the fact that society increasingly needs more professionals who are oriented towards this sector, there are hardly any specific plans that will provide them with appropriate training. The appearance of service science, management, and engineering (SSME) has led to a significant advance as regards understanding the skills required by a service professional. It is a transdisciplinary field that integrates aspects of business management, along with information and communication technologies and engineering, and social sciences, in addition to providing the foundations for the growth of sustainable business. This paper presents a curriculum for the training of professionals in service engineering, which has been designed and taught at a Spanish public university. This curriculum, which the university created in collaboration with SSME experts and service sector companies, stands out for two reasons: the transdisciplinary approach employed, which is one of the features of this emerging and integrative knowledge discipline, and the fact that it is providing a response to the need for higher education curricula for sustainable business development. The paper describes the method followed to create the curriculum for the Bachelor's Degree in Service Engineering, a comparative study with other related degrees, and the results of the deployment of the degree in terms of employability.\",\n",
              " \"Haute cuisine, the cooking style for fine dining at gourmet restaurants, has changed over the last decades and can be expected to evolve in the upcoming years. To engage in foresight, the purpose of this study is to identify a plausible future trend scenario for the haute cuisine sector within the next five to ten years, based on today's chefs' views. To achieve this goal, an international, two-stage Delphi study was conducted. The derived scenario suggests that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic will lead to significant restaurant bankruptcies and will raise creativity and innovation among the remaining ones. It is expected that haute cuisine tourism will grow and that menu prices will differ for customer segments. More haute cuisine restaurants will open in Asia and America. Local food will remain a major trend and will be complemented by insect as well as plant-based proteins and sophisticated nonalcoholic food pairings. Restaurant design and the use of scents will become more relevant. Also, private dining and fine dining at home will become more important. The scenario also includes negative projections. These findings can serve as a research agenda for future research in haute cuisine, including the extension of the innovation lens towards the restaurant and the business model. Practical implications include the necessity for haute cuisine restaurants to innovate to cope with increasing competition in several regions. Customers should be seen as co-creators of the value of haute cuisine.\",\n",
              " 'The notion of Heritage has remained within a constant historic evolution, following a cohesive approach which has led to ever more integrating concepts regarding its setting and scope. While, the development of societies requires models that allow understanding heritage as comprehensive, since it is essential to reach a holistic understanding and management of the territory, all of which leads to an interest about Territorial Heritage. In this way, the goal of this work is to make a theoretical-conceptual revision about the notion of Territorial Heritage in the case of Spain, a complex and dynamic concept that remains open. For this, the methodology has been developed in three stages and consists in a bibliographical review between the 1990s and 2020, focused on the studies available online, which has allowed identifying the existing discussion on the concept, the main topics and their difficulties. The results show that the concept of Territorial Heritage has had diverse theoretical applications like, for example in landscape, tourism, sustainable development, IT, territorial organization, design and management model. However, it continues to be a notion that requires a greater determination about the scales of application, in the universe of elements it intends to address and in their implementation under management and/or planning tools that can make its embodiment possible. Ultimately, the concept remains in development, keeping the scientific discussion alive, mainly from the technical point of view, as its practical application is still incipient. Copyright',\n",
              " 'National parks have been observed to have lots of socio-economic advantages on the livelihood of host communities. The study examined the impact of Saiful Malook national park on the economy and livelihood of the people of Naran and Kaghan Communities in Pakistan. Primary and secondary sources of data were employed for the study. The study revealed that there is a significant difference in the number of indigenous and non-indigenous people involved in ecotourism activities in the area. The study also observed that 33% and 28% of the entire visitors to the park got information about the park and its facilities through the social media and friends and family members and these were the strongest medium of awareness of the national park. The study result also revealed that indigenous people enjoyed more of the accruing benefits from the park than non-indigenous people. It was also observed that although the national park attracts lots of benefits to the host communities such as the provision of employment opportunities, improved family and individual income, there were also observed challenges such as seasonality of tourism activities in the park and changes in the cultural values of the local people. Based on these findings, the study recommended that government and the management of the park should use all available medium of communication to advertise and market the park facilities and products to improve the number of visitors to the park and its patronage.',\n",
              " 'Mountain husbandry systems and their related products may directly or indirectly provide either ecosystem services (ESs) or disservices to humanity. The present study aims to evaluate the perception that a local mountain community has towards animal husbandry in the Lanzo Valleys (Piedmont, Italy) and towards the typical local dairy product, Toma di Lanzo, as well as to investigate the consumers habits and preferences, to detect possible positive impacts on mountain tourism. A questionnaire was delivered to 233 respondents. The perception of the impact was scored using a five-point Likert scale. The results show a very positive perception of the product Toma di Lanzo because of its origin and type of processing, with different perceptions of the local society depending on age (p < 0.01), residence (p < 0.01), and education level (p < 0.05). The respondents had a very positive awareness of the impact of mountain livestock farming in the Lanzo Valleys. The most important perceived ESs are cultural identity and maintenance of local breeds. Women, non-residents, and respondents with an intermediate education level generally had a more positive perception of ESs. There was a very low perception of disservices derived from mountain animal farming. The main perceived obstacles to the spread of benefits derived from these farming systems were the scarce presence of specific supporting politics and the low income generated by mountain farming activities. The coexistence of touristic activities and extensive livestock farming systems has to be associated with a better promotion of mountain products like Toma di Lanzo to improve the sustainability of mountain regions.',\n",
              " 'Social media advertising, with its interactivity, has become a critical site for brand-consumer relationship building. Recent work on its use for relational functions is primarily confined to the field of marketing, yet little attention has been paid to the linguistic devices that support relationship building on social media plarforms. In this paper, an empirical study is conducted on the use of metadiscourse in WeChat public account advertisements (hereafter WPA ads). Specifically, it examines how three interactional metadiscourse subcategories (engagement markers, self-mentions, and attitude markers) are used for relational acts in Chinese WPA ads. Analysis was conducted on 50 selected advertisements published in 2018 on the public WeChat accounts of five brands in different industries (mobile phone, laptop, tourism, electric appliance, and motorcar). The results indicate that engagement markers, self-mentions, and attitude markers, along with their distinctive linguistic devices, are used to perform the relational acts of directing, addressing, and expressing in WPA ads. This study extends the scope of metadiscourse research by investigating the use of metadiscourse in WPA ads while contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the interpersonal function of metadiscourse in WPA ads. It has implications for the technical writing of WPA ads, raising advertisers awareness of how to employ metadiscourse to build solidarity with readers and manage their corporate image in an era of e-commerce. It also evidences the usefulness of applying a pragmatic concept to metadisocurse research, providing insight into how metadiscourse might be approached by drawing on notions from fields other than discourse analysis.',\n",
              " \"Located in the south of the western Mediterranean, in the central Algerian region, the Cherchell coastal aquifer has participated over time in the economic development of the region (agriculture and seaside tourism). The construction of the Boukerdene dam in the watershed of the region, thus the exploitation of the aquifer in response to the excessive demand of agriculture and the potable water supply, has caused the piezometric level of the aquifer to decline and threatens its sustainability and makes it more vulnerable to marine intrusion, noting that no work has been realized in this study area despite the inestimable value of this aquifer in the region, it's the only aquifer in Cherchell town. The aim of this paper is to map the vulnerability of this aquifer to marine intrusion, based on the proven methodology of the GALDIT model for coastal aquifers combined with Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The GALDIT methodology requires six input parameters: groundwater occurrence (G), aquifer hydraulic conductivity (A), groundwater head above sea level (L), distance from the shore (D), impact of the existing status of seawater intrusion l'impact (I), and thickness of the aquifer (T). The results indicate low to moderate vulnerability upstream and high vulnerability downstream. This high vulnerability can be as much as 700 m from shoreline inland. This vulnerability is mainly due to the hydrological disruption linked to the construction of the Boukerdene dam, which reduces surface water inflows. These results provide a basic tool for local managers and decision-makers, for future management and protection strategies for the Cherchell area aquifer in the face of marine intrusion.\",\n",
              " \"This study aims to investigate the effect of sensation seeking and food neophobia personality traits on the intention of foreign tourists to buy traditional Turkish food. The sample of the study, 500 foreign tourists who visited the Istanbul Historic Peninsula in the summer of 2018 were surveyed by easy sampling method. In the first phase 100 participants were asked to fill personal information form, food neophobia scale, brief sensation seeking scale and purchase intention scale. The obtained data were analyzed in SPSS program. After the pilot survey normality test, Cronbach's alpha coefficients and factor analysis were used to construct validity and reliability of food neophobia, brief sensation seeking scale and purchase intention scales. After ensuring the validity and reliability of statements in the survey form, 400 more survey forms were filled by participants to complete the major survey. After the data acquisition phase, regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of food neophobia and sensation-seeking on purchase intention. The analysis showed that food neophobia has a considerably great impact on purchase intention. Results also showed that tourists with a low level of food neophobia show a high-level of purchase intention on Turkish traditional meals. On the SS side of the study it was found that experience-seeking is the only sub-scale of sensation-seeking that affects purchase intention. Consequently, experience seeking has a negative correlation with food neophobia. According to study results personality plays role in what people want to it. This information can be used to achieve more revenue and promote Turkish cuisine through tourism. Some suitable Turkish foods can be customized on the same line with major culinary cultures in the world for highly food neophobic tourists and also unique Turkish foods can be introduced to highly experience-seeker visitors.\",\n",

              " 'The karst mountainous area is an ecologically fragile region with prominent human-land contradictions. The resource-environment carrying capacity (RECC) of this region needs to be further clarified. The development of remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) provides data sources and processing platform for RECC monitoring. This study analyzed and established the evaluation index system of RECC by considering particularity in the karst mountainous area of Southwest China; processed multisource RS data (Sentinel-2, Aster-DEM and Landsat-8) to extract the spatial distributions of nine key indexes by GIS techniques (information classification, overlay analysis and raster calculation); proposed the methods of index integration and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation of the RECC by GIS; and took a typical area, Guangnan County in Yunnan Province of China, as an experimental area to explore the effectiveness of the indexes and methods. The results showed that: (1) The important indexes affecting the RECC of karst mountainous area are water resources, tourism resources, position resources, geographical environment and soil erosion environment. (2) Data on cultivated land, construction land, minerals, transportation, water conservancy, ecosystem services, topography, soil erosion and rocky desertification can be obtained from RS data. GIS techniques integrate the information into the RECC results. The data extraction and processing methods are feasible on evaluating RECC. (3) The RECC of Guangnan County was in the mid-carrying level in 2018. The mid-carrying and low-carrying levels were the main types, accounting for more than 80.00% of the total study area. The areas with high carrying capacity were mainly distributed in the northern regions of the northwest-southeast line of the county, and other areas have a low carrying capacity comparatively. The coordination between regional resource-environment status and socioeconomic development is the key to improve RECC. This study explores the evaluation index system of RECC in karst mountainous area and the application of multisource RS data and GIS techniques in the comprehensive evaluation. The methods can be applied in related fields to provide suggestions for data/information extraction and integration, and sustainable development.',\n",
              " 'Indonesia has the highest forest density in the world, and the productivity of its forests can potentially be maximized to minimize CO2 emissions. However, due to anthropogenic activities, phenological properties are subject to risk to ensure productivity and carbon exchange in the different forest ecosystems in Indonesia. Early prediction of carbon values could indicate a declining trend of forest quality with reference to vegetation levels. Thus, the purpose of this research is to evaluate forest productivity and carbon stock using phonological properties for different forests. The vegetation phenology was used to assess the level of forest productivity with different classifications to estimate carbon stock in six types of forest in south Sumatera using gross primary productivity (GPP) approaches. The vegetation phenologies were analyzed to develop a system dynamics model under two scenarios: first, a changing trend of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and second, a changing trend of area, considering either increasing or decreasing solar radiation in both scenarios. This system was run through the GIS environment to develop a database and to simulate results for future predictions. Verification was performed to test the simulation model by comparing the results with the IPCC reference. NDVI showed good correlations with GPP using MODIS MOD13Q1 for convertible production forest (CPF R2 = 0.97), permanent production forest, PPF (R2 = 0.99), limited production forest (LPF, R2 = 0.98), tourism recreation forest (TRF, R2 = 0.95), and wildlife reserve forest (WRF, R2 = 0.95), nature reserve forest (NRF, R2 = 0.99). The explicit differential function was used to estimate netprimary productivity (NPP), which was related to the changes in area and productivity over time. Productivity and carbon stock analysis was performed via the proposal of five levels referring to Indonesian forest policy planning, considering resilience classified as high forest productivity (V1), moderate forest productivity (V2), marginal forest productivity (V3), very low forest productivity (N1), and no forest productivity (N2). TRF was found fall below the IPCC levels from 2015 to 2017, and NRF fall below the IPCC standards from 2015 to 2018. Therefore, the satellite-based remote sensing, system dynamics model can be implemented in the Indonesian forest policy system for assessing forest productivity and carbon stocks.',\n",
              " 'The 21st century has seen a cycling renaissance across Europe with many cities moving away from the car-centric infrastructure, urban design and planning policies prevalent since the 1950s. Southern European island cities, which exhibit certain characteristics considered as barriers to cycling, such as hot summers and high humidity, hilliness, and car-oriented culture and infrastructure however, have been lagging behind in this resurgence of cycling. Despite this, bicycle sharing systems (BSS) and policies promoting cycling have emerged in this region. These have the potential to provide alternatives for those marginalized by car-based mobility and to reduce traffic related diseases and injuries, noise and air pollution, which can contribute to an improved quality of life for all citizens. Using the coastal city of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria (Canary Islands, Spain) as a case study, the utilization of bike-sharing is investigated through a questionnaire to users of the shared bicycles, as well as through spatial analysis of the BSS trip data. The analysis of the survey, through descriptive and inferential statistics, allows for an understanding of the demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the users, and the inter- and intra-personal factors influencing the choice to use a shared bicycle as a mode of transport. Results show that distance to nearest station, money-saving and environmental concerns, satisfaction with the operating system, and provision of safe cycling infrastructure significantly influence BSS use. A regression model is constructed to assess the influence of spatial factors such as land use, socio-economic characteristics and network variables on the use of the BSS. From the regression model it appears that the presence of cycling infrastructure, proximity to a bus station and the density of tourism accommodation, and by proxy, the number of cafes and restaurants, near bicycle sharing stations positively influences frequency of use. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the role of the BSS in the promotion of cycling and the transition to sustainable and inclusive mobility policies, which are still contested in the car-centric transport system currently dominating the city.',\n",
              " 'Social innovations (SIs) are new ideas that create collaboration or new social relationships and thus meet local needs. The purpose of the research is to understand the role of SIs and community-based quadruple-helix actors in rural development. The research question is how do community-based quadruple-helix actors contribute to the formation of SI networks in the context of rural development? The triple helix model represents innovations as emerging in cooperation between three helices (university, industry, and government). The quadruple helix (QH) adds civil society as a fourth helix. Using the QH model in rural development requires a broad definition of the helices. In addition to universities, all types of educational and research institutes are important. In addition, different types of public organisations are important, not just the government. We define the fourth helix as representing civil society as a community, not just individual citizens. Our main argument is that the QH model fosters understanding of the variety of formal and informal ways in which SI enables societal development in rural areas. We examine the relevant relationships with the help of the strands of literature on SI and QH, and also a case study on projects conducted under the LEADER programme (Aktion sterbotten) in Finland. The case study is based on a narrative approach inspired by the learning history method, with the identification of critical incidents, which help us to identify how the QH evolves throughout successful community-driven SIs. The narrative approach reveals the significance of informal communities in transforming QH relations. Many projects under the LEADER programme aim to strengthen the attraction of communities by promoting local identity, including broad participation in collective events, such as enjoying nature, cultural events, sports, and other social activities. Many of those activities have the potential to spill over into other types of SI, such as entrepreneurship oriented towards tourism and new solutions to social needs. The decisive factor for the success of the projects was the involvement of local communities. The local knowledge of the communities was nourished in the projects in interaction with other local and extra-local QH actors. Accordingly, the main contribution of the paper is combining the notions of SI and the QH, and presenting the fourth helix as a community enabling rural development. We call this rural development model the community-driven QH model.',\n",

In the post-Apartheid period, cultural policies have been employed as catch-all policies that could lead to urban renewal, desegregation and development. The case of the RLMCP drives home how efforts to use art and culture as leverages to transform townships into the core of the creative city and into the prototype of a new form of neighbourhood led to exclusionary representations and patterns; moreover, it is an example of how cultural policies enforce gentrification dynamics at the local level, in the name of restructuring urban governance and rescaling the city to the global dimension.',\n",

Here people experience the beautiful Indian Ocean coastline, extensive dinosaur footprints, storytelling, and meals of freshly caught fish, mangrove crab, dugong and turtle. These trails are far more than tourism products. For the Aboriginal families, with all ages present, they enact inter-generational knowledge transfer. Academic disciplines also change when they are on Country: Palaeontologists learn that the dinosaur footprints are also the traces of the emu ancestor, marala, and their discipline adjusts its epistemological parameters accordingly. Aboriginal walking trails have the potential to change every discipline willing to re-boot on a territorial, rather than global, scale. Walking with ones arts of paying attention on alert deepens and extends both European and Aboriginal knowledge, as they find agencies that can transfer and translate the multi-functionality inherent in the ecological pluriverse that is this continent-wide network of dreaming tracks. Could this experiential model of knowledge transfer represent a path away from the nineteenth-century model of knowledge collection, storage and display that we find in universities and museums?. ; 2020 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.',\n",

The problems caused in some destinations by the increasing growth in tourism have resulted in the recent introduction of the term overtourism, recalling issues discussed in the literature since the early 70s. This paper aims to answer the question of whether overtourism is a novel issue through an initial exploratory study.',\n",

The present work considers the concept of Involvement and Memorability as new drivers for positive outcomes for both the tourism and food industry and proposes a new approach to loyalty. The partial least squares technique has been employed for data analysis. Data have been achieved by a survey addressed to tourists who had a culinary experiencecooking class, food tour, tastings, etc.during a recent travel. Findings of this research show that involvement and memorable food-based experiences can help the long-lasting loyalty of food tourists towards both local products and the destination. Results show that culinary experiences can involve tourists, provide positive memories and patronize new clients, fostering their intention to keep buying, from their place of residence, the local products tasted during a holiday and to revisit the destination in the future.',\n",

Nonetheless, little is known about the factors shaping international tourists acceptance of local cuisine. Through an application of the Tri-Component Attitude Model, this study explores how attitudes are influenced by food-related personality traits of tourists. Using a survey of 396 international tourists, the study provides insights into the role of neophilia in explaining tourists cognitive, affective and conative responses toward local cuisines. The findings verify the significant influence of food neophilia and highlights the confounding effects of tourists idiosyncrasies.

              " 'Satisfaction is one of the most studied constructs in many fields, including tourism. As an important marketing metric, satisfaction is typically measured with self-reported retrospective evaluations of travel experience. However, the memory-based approaches have numerous limitations related to social desirability, availability heuristics, previous knowledge, mood at the time of answering questions and do not reflect the moment-by-moment nature of visitor experience. The shortcomings and limitations of self-reported retrospective evaluations could be eliminated by introducing pre-visit, on-site, and post-visit instant components of experienced utility as measures of visitor experience. The experienced utility allows eliminating the majority of self-report biases, capturing the affective components of visitor experience, analysing relationships between anticipation, experienced, and remembered utilities, and applying emerging moment-based research techniques. Therefore, this manuscript proposes a measurable definition of experienced utility and appropriate measures to assess visitor experience.',\n",

These music festival events not only invite composers to demonstrate their musical creations. But also they assist many independent bands realizing their musical dreams. This study analyzes how to influence the event image of music festival events for event participants. And it explores how factors that affect the tourist experience and enhance the event image related to this kind of activity. This study used four aspects to build a development strategies map utilizing the DEMATEL technique for the music festival events and establishes the group components of the PCA technique and then adopts the ANP technique to evaluate the aspects/components weights. Finally, the VIKOR technique was utilized to assess the competitive performance of the music festival events. The research reveals that the PP (package price) and SP (site planning) are primary influencers for music festival events. The event service providers can improve their promotional strategies by the NRM (network relation map) technique. This research provides recommendations for service providers to enhance their equipment plans and service experiences for music festival events.',\n",
              " 'Facebook has become a vital tool for businesses to market themselves and stand out above the competition. This is also true for the high number of dive operators that form an essential part of the marine tourism industry. Dive operators often use Facebook as a means of reaching potential clients as well as forging relationships and a sense of loyalty with their existing clients. However, little to no information is available on divers preferences when it comes to Facebook engagement and whether different segments of the diving market resemble different preferences. The purpose of this study was therefore to develop a CIA-typology (Connection seekers, Inclusive seekers, and Attention seekers) based on divers preferences for social media page aspects (dissemination, environmental information, personalisation, and distinction) that persuade them to interact and their type of engagement (active engagement and lurking behaviour). This was done through an online questionnaire distributed worldwide through snowball sampling. This study revealed that Facebook followers are heterogeneous and that followers can be segmented according to their engagement preferences. This research can assist dive operators in displaying the correct messages at the most appropriate times to ensure their Facebook followers engage with their posts, thereby maximizing their marketing efforts.',\n",

For its part, Community-Based Tourism (CBT) presents itself as one of the practical possibilities of rethinking and prospecting a development based on an organic articulation between humans and between humans and non-humans, rescuing and updating the sense of community in harmony with nature. Methodologically, we used a theoretical review with critical analysis and case study of the CBT Program in Trawun de Panguipulli, southern Chile. Through a discussion / reflection, between these concepts we sought to discuss elements that approach or distance themselves between the topics in order to contribute to this purpose. The objective of this article is to dialogue on the theme of Community Based Tourism as an alternative and emancipatory strategy of development from the perpective of Good Living. It was concluded that, thinking about new paradigms based on ontological perspectives, also supposes facing the challenge of proposing projects that can dispute the logic of appropriation and in time, strengthen and reaffirm the territories and territorial identities of, rural communities, peasants and native peoples.',\n",
              " \"Nowadays, the importance of tourism is increasingly growing. Tourism contributes to socioeconomic development and increases gross domestic product (GDP), which is manifested in its capacity to create new jobs, reduce unemployment, stimulate investment and budget revenues, redistribute income from richer to poorer regions, and increase the quality of life of local communities. The main purpose of the paper is to assess the tourist potential of Poland and its individual voivodeships in the years 2010-2019 on the basis of selected indices of the tourism function. The empirical section is based on an analysis of the value of six indices of the tourism function development, including, among others, the Schneider, Defert and Charvat indices, etc. The values of the indices obtained for the tourism function development have confirmed the positive changes taking place in the tourism sector in Poland over the last ten years. In 2019, the average number of bed-places per 100 inhabitants in Poland was 2.22 (Baretje-Defert index). The values of the Charvat and Schneider indices also illustrate the positive changes in the tourism sector in Poland. In 2019, on average, approx. 244 tourist overnight stays were provided per 100 inhabitants, and on average there were approx. 93 tourists per 100 inhabitants. In conclusion, with each passing year, the values of indices representing the tourism function development have increased, which in the context of the country's untapped tourist potential should be encouraging. Unfortunately, this positive trend has been hampered by the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. Therefore, it appears even more necessary to carry out further analyses of the tourism sector. The ongoing monitoring of changes in the values of the tourism function development indices can actually contribute to the development of adequate measures to minimise the effects of the pandemic on the economy and society, including the tourism industry.\",\n",

The purpose of this research is to identify the factors of cultural sphere development in the EU countries due to its importance for the system of creative industries and the process of social capital accumulation, outlining the possibilities of European experience adaptation in this sphere for Ukraine. The scientific and methodology approaches were developed to the definition of cultural sphere development factors in the EU countries from the point of view of its influence on the formation of social capital and creative industries. A comparative analysis of socio-economic development of cultural sphere in 2011-2019 was realized, including evaluation of spatial differences in its functioning on the base of variation indicators calculating and tracking their dynamics. The specification of multiple regression models was done, in which the explained variables became employment in cultural sphere (Y1) and the value of its gross value added (Y2). It is found out that the place and significance of the cultural sphere for the national economy of each EU country differ, whereas the environment of its functioning is relatively stable, which contributes to the formation of proper conditions for the accumulation of social capital and the development of creative industries. It is substantiated that spatial differences in cultural sphere development have been intensified in the EU countries due to the different intensity of social capital and creative industries network formation. The multiple regression analysis revealed that a number of explanatory variables (demographic situation, tourism activity, unemployment rate, and education index) influence employment and gross value added of the cultural sphere. It is determined that for the cultural sphere of Ukraine, taking into account the European integration and experience of the EU countries, it is important to ensure the stability of cultural sphere, minimize the effects of the demographic crisis, promote tourism development, and regulate the employment policy, which, due to synergy, will influence the social capital and the positions of creative industries in the national economy.',\n",
              " 'How farms can create and maintain sustainable agritourism is yet to be fully addressed. Given its link with sustainable development, research on agritourism sustainability, while highlighting the positive consequences, has neglected the theoretical perspectives. We thus find a lacuna in holistically understanding its driving processes and, consequently, its conceptualization. In response, this article draws extensively on the ecological economics co-evolutionary framework to explain the intertwined dynamics underlying sustainable agritourism and its determinants. Co-evolution conceives the organizationsenvironments relationship as circular, with mutual influence, and dialectical. We analyze the dynamics of the farmrural destination relationship through a longitudinal analysis of 20 Italian agritourism farms. We find that sustainable agritourism emerges within rural destinations through diffused multilevel interactions and feedbacks resulting in organizational practices that enhance the farm and regions identities, and thus competitiveness. We offer an interpretative framework that conceptualizes sustainable agritourism through effective multilevel co-evolutionary adaptations and identify four determinants: strategic intentionality, rural lifestyle experience, systemic approach, and social responsibility. This approach may help farmers and policymakers develop destinations through sustainable agritourism. Implications for future research and practice in the sustainable tourism field emerge.',\n",

Bibliometric analysis of 839 sustainable tourism-related papers over a thirty-year period (19872017), extracted from a selection of the top ranked tourism journals confirmed a lack of reticulation and integration among individual contributions, in part due to an exponential increase in output, but parallel evidence of subdomain maturation. This includes reduced emphasis on definitional issues and increased focus on empirical applications as well as a broader pragmatic turn indicated by the dominance of stakeholder contributions related to industry and community. These moreover are qualified by recognition of the need to adopt and develop higher standards of methodological and theoretical engagement. We innovate by analysing engagement with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and reveal these to constitute a major latent theme, albeit to widely variable extents. It is recommended that these be mobilised as a pragmatic and universally embraced framework for engaging with sustainable tourism and salient external threats such as climate change.',\n",

It fills an important gap in existing ethnographic literature on the region and confidently navigates what had previously been considered uncharted, even unchartable, waters -- that wide sea between the classic ethnography of Oceania and contemporary anthropology's theoretical concerns with global relations and transnational cultures. Its breadth, rigour, and timely contribution to post-colonial politics in Oceania are certain to ensure that this book will provide an enduring contribution to the field.\",\n",

The study is conducted through detailed and accurate photographic and iconographic documentation, survey and digital documentation with accessible models. The present work, therefore, proposes to document and reconstruct graphically, the historical evolution of the Hvar Tvrdalj Fortress in Croatia through a series of digital drawings, but especially 3d photogrammetric modeling systems of outdoor spaces. Particular attention was paid to the digital modeling activities of the fishpond, located inside the fortified structure. The activity of representation of the Fortress of Hvar Tvrdalj was set up by providing, in an initial phase, the execution of a basic survey extended to the architectural organisms and the surrounding green space in order to define a first two-dimensional geometric model; then, in a second phase, were made the survey graphs and the consequent graphic restitution with the measurements of architectural details and the complete survey of the inner tank. The research, therefore, presents for the first time, a scientific study of photogrammetric digital survey developed through the creation of 3D digital models on a structure of great architectural and landscape interest, as well as a cornerstone of the island of Hvar for local tourism.',\n",

The aim of this paper is to tease out some implications for re-orienting the African tourism research agenda from 2020 and beyond. Arguably, an appropriate African research response to COVID-19 in the context of tourism must embrace a genuine transdisciplinary approach and draw in researchers who would not, historically, have operated in the tourism space. Seven key themes are discussed namely, market confidence; dependence on international long-haul tourists; supporting regional and domestic tourism especially VFR travel; redefining community-based tourism; informal sector resilience; climate change; and, addressing present-mindedness in African tourism scholarship.',\n",

In Botswana, the tourism industry is considered as a major option for economic diversification and current tourism policies include a strong emphasis on tourism that participates in and benefits communities. The developmental impact of tourism depends on how the local communities perceive their livelihood options and the role of tourism. This paper analyses how community members in selected villages in Kalahari Desert perceive the current and estimated future impacts of climate change and how these impacts may influence their livelihoods in future and what role the tourism industry may play in that process. Based on the results, there are minimal local benefits and participation in tourism, which limits the potential of tourism to work for sustainable local development in practice.',\n",

Using Breakwells Identity Process Theory (IPT) as a conceptual framework, we investigate the extent to which place is a part of winery owners self-identities, thereby giving them senses of belonging, distinctiveness, continuity, and self-esteem. Simultaneously, we find that these senses and feelings influence winery owners perceptions of the benefits and dis-benefits of wine tourism development in their region. We also discover how personal involvement in tourism can strengthen or threaten winery owners identities and thereby affect their support or otherwise for wine tourism. Empirical evidence is provided via a sample of twenty-eight winery owners in Langhe, Italy, who have recently engaged in various tourism related-activities due to the continuous development of the local tourism industry.

The fundamental knowledge contributions are examined using a scientometric approach (spatial, productive, of impact, and relational) based on data from records stored in the Web of Science (JCR and ESCI). This approach aims to critically analyze the scientific production on hospitality, leisure, and tourism (HLT) with contributions from authors affiliated with Chile, to respond to the connection between this research, the sectoral education, and sustainable development of the HLT industry. At the results level, an increase in scientific production in the last decade, a breadth revealed in publications quality terms, insertion in worldwide relevance co-authorship networks, an evolution from general issues to those of the discipline itself (cultural tourism, wine tourism, tourism marketing, hospitality industry, and sustainable tourism), a concentration on ecotourism education, and a disconnection between the diverse knowledge-producing centers and those of sectoral training were identified.',\n",

The South African record is significant as national government addresses the apartheid legacy of the historical exclusion of black communities from participation in the mainstream economy. The objective is to examine the potential of leveraging state assets for achieving a more inclusive tourism economy. The specific focus is the use of municipal assets with evidence from the Overstrand local municipality which centres upon the tourist town of Hermanus, Western Cape. This municipality has a significant basket of municipal assets which can be leveraged for tourism development, including for the potential benefit of entrepreneurs from disadvantaged communities.

Concerns arising from the well-being of flora and, in particular, fauna by conservationists; tourists and commercial tourism; and the increasingly restricted use of traditional lands and herding animals by pastoralist indigenous communities, have populated the discourse of land use in Kenya. In this paper, we look into the varying perceptions of each group of stakeholders and seek to analyse the current narrative that gives priority to wildlife protection and the commercial exploitation of wildlife through high-end tourism development to the detriment of the rights and interests of pastoralism. As pastoral land becomes more appropriated, our analysis shows that the antagonistic relationship between conservationism, commercial tourism and pastoralism is likely to deteriorate. We, therefore, propose a more participatory model of tourism development that will allow pastoralist communities to have a voice in the process.',\n",

Yet, questions need to be asked about the nature of employment in tourism, the state of education and skills training in the sector and its prospects for youth. Drawing on a national study, this paper interrogates tourism education and skills training issues in relation to youth employment and development. The findings reveal that youth in the sector find themselves in precarious employment: they typically have low-level skills, do not continue their education or training after being employed and have few career progression options. At the same time, a mismatch between the outcomes of education and skills training in tourism and the requirements of the industry come to the fore. Enhanced skills development and the creation of pathways for learning; labour market access and upward career progression are needed to advance youth in tourism.',\n",

Tourism has both direct and indirect benefits to residents neighboring protected areas, and it can be one of the most innovative ways to resolve human-wildlife conflicts and achieve long-term conservation goals. However, the effectiveness of direct and indirect benefits of tourism has not been settled in the literature. In this paper, the case of the Volcanoes national park is used to empirically examine the conservation effectiveness of direct and indirect tourism benefits for poor residents neighboring the park. Results indicate that direct tourism benefits have more potential to influence change in forest-dependent behavior when the behavior is driven by food security constraints. Additionally, the results suggest that the potential to reduce forest dependence is possible if both direct and indirect tourism benefits are aimed to address health, education and food security risks of poor households in proximity to VNP.',\n",

This study aims to address this particular research gap by undertaking an analytical hierarchical approach to uncover the relative importance of the attributes influencing the attractiveness of Taiwans camping tourism. A list of 33 sector-specific destination-level attributes was generated and was then classified into Tourism Attractions, Accessibility, Amenities, and Supplementary Services categories. The results revealed that the current development of Taiwans camping tourism urges more investment for improving the basic function of infrastructure, creating more supporting infrastructure for relaxation and social interaction, and trying to integrate as much as natural attractions into the camping surroundings. It is concluded that a camping destination is a complex structure whose attractiveness is determined by its capacity to allow visitors to experience the great outdoors with comfort and security and in close contact with nature.',\n",
              " 'Travel writing, an important influence on tourism, is often criticized as hegemonic/colonial by postcolonial studies. This study notes that postcolonial studies invariably solely search for such intentions in representations of societies. A critique of such approach is made by analysing travel writing texts where a postcolonial approach would find hegemonic/colonial intentions, while such intentions are likely absent. This is done by showing that travel writing representations of Portugal (an important tourist destination for tourism which tourism is very significant) are similar to social science representations of the country. These are to a great extent produced by Southern European and Portuguese scientists, making underlying hegemonic/colonial intentions unlikely. It is concluded that the attribution of such intentions to travel writing and other discourses by postcolonial studies should be rethought. One should therefore be careful in using postcolonial studies findings. An alternative mechanism underlying the production of unfavourable representations is proposed that may generate unfavourable representations even when producers of representations do not hold prejudiced views, with crucial implications on tourism and cultural identity.',\n",

As such, it examines the significance of the writers identities to the constructed representations. I demonstrate how these writers have been socialised/indoctrinated into the practice of world citizenship, its institutions and its norms/ethics. Most significantly, they generate a gloss that covers local realities, underlying the cosmetic writing they engage in for tourism. Thus, the paper explores explicitly how this role is firmly intertwined with the privileged, elite position of those that become writers (in English) within the hierarchical class system of Sri Lanka. Using a Bourdieusian framework, I argue that this position of the travel writer is accessible by/restricted to individuals with certain cultural capital such as the English language and education, resources, opportunities to study English literature within elite urban schools and exposure to an international culture of travel and tourism. The knowledge germinated from their writing significantly impacts the way Sri Lanka is represented within legitimised systems of worldmaking /knowledge production leading to particular understandings of Sri Lanka within international tourism.',\n",

The television series was lauded as a celebration of Thai culture, and fans often visited the ancient ruins dressed in traditional Thai clothing. This paper explores the case study of the film tourism phenomenon at Ayutthaya and pays particular attention to the idea of national and cultural identity as a tourism motivation using field observations, media research and purposive interviews. Film tourism has typically been driven by the desire to see the landscapes featured in the media, but in this case, we find that the desire to visit Ayutthaya as a destination is also as much about celebrating the idea of Thainess which is manifested by the accompanying trend of wearing traditional Thai dress.',\n",

By synthesising across these literature streams, we explore the opportunities, constraints and nature of impact investing, and theorise its key determinants in resource scarce contexts. In order to elaborate our theorisation, we content analyse published accounts, namely industry reports and academic literature, to argue for the need for more impact investing in hospitality and tourism, a sector that has traditionally suffered from under-financing and limited politico-economic recognition.

While the network analysis examines the relational aspects, content analysis gained through interviews and focus group discussions were used to understand the specific issues of CMT. The Thousand Islands as one of the priority destinations set up by the Indonesian Ministry of Tourism was chosen as the case study. The overall network graph confirms that CMT in the Thousand Islands is a community-based tourism surrounded mostly by government institutions. Marine transportation organisations are mainly located within the inner circle. Using modularity, the network splits into three clusters, delivering a more in-depth network structure of the CMT. Practical implications of the study are for policy makers to improve stakeholder cooperation to address issues related to the management of marine transportation, water and energy supplies, innovation in natural and cultural attractions and greater development of human resources.',\n",

The roles could be realised between a community and an individual from within or outside the community. It is further proposed that understanding the roles and the relationships provides possibilities for community empowerment and sustainable community development within CBT settings.

              " 'The research problem this paper is concerned with is the effect of tourism on solid waste generation in Croatias coastal area. We are aware of the fact that this has not been thoroughly addressed, especially considering tourisms share in the Croatian economy and the pressure it generates on sustainable coastal management. This is of particular importance considering the governing complexity of coastal areas. Thus, we ask a simple question regarding the role of the tourism industry in the solid waste generation in the Croatian coastal area: Do tourists generate relatively more solid waste than the domestic population? The falsifiable hypothesis is stated in terms of the difference in the production of communal waste between domestic population and tourists, taking into account local idiosyncratic factors, when such a difference is recoverable through statistical analysis of measurable tourist presence in panel data. The first hypothesis is thus: The amount of solid waste produced by local residents in Croatian coastal municipalities diverges significantly in statistical terms from the amount of solid waste produced by tourists. The second hypothesis is: The amount of waste-streams is influenced by local idiosyncrasies of coastal settlements, their economic structure, per capita GDP and/or cultural background of local people. Our dataset is a panel of 160 municipalities in the Croatian coastal area spanned across a time period of 12 months during 2019, giving us a total of 1920 panel observations. We performed a Panel Estimated Generalized Least Squares cross-section fixed effects analysis with Panel Corrected Standard Errors on domestic population and tourist overnight stays and their solid waste generation. We used the above mentioned method to achieve better results with higher significance, and lower Standard Errors than comparable methods. We complemented the analysis with a dynamic Panel Generalized Method of Moments First Differences test. Results show a relatively larger relative impact of tourist overnight stays on municipal solid waste generation than what is to be expected from the locals only. Our different methods of analysis ended with non-contradicting results. The number of tourist overnight stays in some municipalities shadows the overnight stays of the local population as an indicator of solid waste generation, exacerbating the problem of sustainability of waste disposal. We conclude that the relative waste disposal impact of the tourists is at least 22% greater and possibly up to 55% greater than the one of local inhabitants, contradicting some other research.

Data were collected from 384 tourism SME owners using a structured questionnaire. The results indicate that managerial capability has a significant positive effect on SME performance and is in turn influenced by managers autonomy and competence. The study does find a significant relationship between innovation capability and SME performance. Given the socio-economic importance of SMEs to the Mauritian economy, the results provide crucial information to government and policy-makers that can used to develop macro-economic policies that increase their contribution to the socio-economic development of the country. For entrepreneurs, the study provides insights on areas of interventions that can lead to an improvement in the financial performance of their organisations. Despite the study limitations, it contributes to a theoretical understanding of the determinants of financial performance in African economies.',\n",

              " 'This paper examines Sustainable-Oriented Innovation (SOI) practices among micro and small firms operating in the tourism and hospitality sectors. In this paper, we argue that firm owners are driven by different forms of lifestyle motivations when conducting their business, with innovative practices reflecting and underlying factors of sustainable development. A qualitative method based on semi-structured interviews was undertaken with 25 owners/managers of firms recognised as being leading actors in sustainability innovation. Findings indicate that the owner/managers values had a direct impact on the way the business was structured and managed as well as on SOI practices implementation. Indeed, entrepreneurs who embrace social responsibility and environmental sustainability as lifestyle motivation in their day-to-day business practices and stakeholder relationship proved to be more committed to SOI. The study has theoretical and practical implications in terms of potential to increase understanding of alternative business models and develop the theory further in this domain.',\n",
              " 'It has often been pointed out, by several researchers in postcolonial studies, that despite several distinctive images of the Orient produced by Orientalists, most of them extensively associated the East with the Other. Thus, the perspective of postcolonial theories is that of trying to deconstruct the cultural dominance of Western colonizing subjects, and its impact on the present situation in former colonial nations. However, in contrast, in the case of attitudes in East European countries to non-European colonized people and their lands, there are concerns about the applicability of the critical concepts of domination or subordination. On the basis of a study of the perceptions of tourists from Slovakia visiting India and travel agencies providing services to the Indian subcontinent, this paper tries to capture some of the tendencies prevailing in recent images of India in the Slovak tourism sector. The evidence presented in this paper suggests that the Orientalist view of other cultures that formed during the colonial era can no longer be considered as solely a matter of the encounter between Anglo-European and Indian cultures, but instead, recently represents globalized way of thinking in the Westernized world.',\n",

Sensors in smart homes are able to interconnect devices such as thermostats, washing machines, television sets, laptops, tablets, and other objects to the Internet of Things platforms. New digital technologies have introduced important innovations in factories, hospitals, hotels, cities and territories. Industry 4.0 is signaling the end of well-established patterns and is asking scholars, managers and citizens willing to survive in this ever-changing and increasingly complex environment to observe it through different lenses and new paradigms. The tourism sector, also, is very much involved in digital transformations, increasingly qualifying them with expressions such as Tourism 4.0 or Smart Tourism. What impact does the digital revolution have on tourism? What do tourism 4.0 and smart tourism have in common? What are the main differences? Adopting a conceptual approach and focusing on the travel and tourism industry, our work aims to provide a point of view and some preliminary answers to the above questions. In paragraph 1 we illustrate the main changes brought about by the digital revolution 4.0 in industry, the Web, and tourism. Then, the concepts of tourism 4.0 and smart tourism are compared in Sect.2. Section3 illustrates how the consumer experience of digital tourists changes before, during, and after the trip. Paragraphs 4 and 5 illustrate the challenges of tourism destinations and tourism ecosystems in the smart perspective. In the final section of the paper, we highlight that in the near future it will not be possible for tourism ecosystems and territories to only take into account digital innovations, but they will have to include smart tourism perspectives like sustainability, circular economy, quality of life, and social value; they should also aim to enhance tourism experiences and to increase the competitive advantage of smart tourism destinations. Tourism 4.0 technologies need to be geared toward the improvement of the quality of tourism practices, assuming smartness and sustainability as the right paradigm for improving the quality of life and the social value of both guests and local residents.',\n",

Unplanned development can lead to a loss in opportunity to access the potential of these resources or cause their damage. Development decisions need to adopt a sustainable approach that balances tourism growth with the preservation of the natural and cultural assets. The present research details a comprehensive assessment tool to study the sustainability of tourism in hill towns with a focus on Shimla, a popular hill destination in India. The tool specifies seven dimensions of sustainable tourism; 1) Tourism Assets; 2) Tourism Activity; 3) Tourism Related Linkages; 4) Tourism Related Leakages; 5) Environmental and Social Sustainability; 6) Infrastructure; and 7) Attractiveness. Primary data were collected through questionnaire surveys of local households and arriving tourists. Visual survey is conducted to map built-environment and land-use. Secondary data were gathered from government reports and scholarly articles. A framework of indicators and sub-indicators was developed to analyze the data at two levels  city and ward. While the appraisal of the city provides an overall view of the performance of the tourism industry, at the ward level a comparative analysis was carried out to reveal sector related potentials and issues. The study reveals the imbalanced tourism concentration in the core of the city as compared to other wards and the gap between tourist potential and infrastructure development. These are addressed through planning recommendations for more balanced development with a focus on eco-tourism. The research helps develop a framework which paves way to sustainable tourism development in Indian hill towns.',\n",
              " 'Water resources play a critical role in the sustainable development of river-based tourism. Reduced stream flow on the Lijiang River, south China, may negatively impact the development of cruise tourism. We explored the effects of stream flow changes on cruise tourism by determining (1) cruise tourism development indicators, (2) stream flow regime characteristics and their impacts on cruise tourism development indicators, and (3) climate variability and socio-economic factors effecting stream flow. Cruise tourism on the river has experienced rapid growth in recent decades. Stream flow regimes displayed no significant changes between 1960 and 2016, although dry season stream flow was significantly lower than in other seasons. We found that stream flow changes did not have a significant impact on the development of cruise tourism. As precipitation has not changed significantly, policies, including regulated stream flow from hydroelectric reservoirs, are assumed to mitigate reduced stream flow. However, increased irrigation and economic development, combined with future climate change, may increase challenges to cruise tourism. Future reservoir operations should prepare for climate change-related increases in temperature and insignificant changes in precipitation, and adopt adaptive measures, such as rationing water use in various sectors, to mitigate water shortages for supporting sustainable tourism development.',\n",

The development of night tourism is one of the crucial means to enrich and prosper the night-time economy. Recently, as a popular topic of sustainable development, night tourism has received extensive attention. However, little attention has been paid to night tourism, especially from the emotional perspective of tourists. Furthermore, discussions on how and why tourists become interested in night tourism are still lacking. To fill the research gap, based on the theory of experience economy, we used the concept of lovemarks to explore the influence of tourists\\' tourism experience and lovemarks on their brand satisfaction and brand loyalty. A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 487 tourists of \"Cultural Heritage Night\", a night tourism brand in South Korea. The results indicate that tourists\\' entertainment and educational experience significantly influence their lovemarks (both of brand love and respect), and esthetic experience only significantly influences brand respect. Furthermore, the influence of tourists\\' lovemarks on brand satisfaction and loyalty is also validated. To retain the sustainable development of night-time economy and night tourism, local authorities and destination managers are recommended to provide night tourism brands (products) with optimal experience effects and entirely emotional and functional attributes.',\n",

Uniquely, a case study was developed involving two different nature of tourism destinations (semirural and rural) and is incorporated into the framework to assess its moderating effect on the relationships among the predictors and destination marketing efforts. Two hundred and ninety-three usable responses were collected using a questionnaire survey. Partial least squares structural equation modelling was utilized to perform latent variable and multi-group analyses (MGA). The findings revealed that destination appeal was found to be the biggest concern among tourists visiting semirural and rural tourism destinations in Sarawak. For intangible components, both service quality and destination image were found to be significantly related to destination marketing efforts at a semirural tourism destination. Interestingly, for MGA results, it was worthwhile to learn that the relationship between service quality and destination marketing efforts happened to have a stronger impact on semirural than rural tourism destination. Hence, the proposed framework and research findings from this case study have provided significant insights that help various tourism stakeholders to better strategize and position semirural and rural tourism, particularly in the scenario of Sarawak, Malaysia. Future studies can examine this framework and test at other tourism destinations in Malaysia or in some other countries.',\n",

Second, it shows how a destination that is experiencing stagnation can temporarily boost its performance and improve its long-term welfare by reorienting the supply from a highly price-sensitive mass tourism product towards a more selective one of the luxury tourism. This change in focus is discussed in the light of the experience of two Spanish archipelagos.

There is an implicit assumption that the technological innovations of Tourism 4.0 work better for the benefits of tourists. However, even marvels of tourism information technology often come with a serious lack of human-centered design. The unprecedented speed of development and implementation of Tourism 4.0 technology further adds to this neglect. In addition, traditional approaches to designing the user experience of interactive systems are now seriously challenged by the disruption of traditional views on the goals of system use, more complex user roles, and the dynamic and hybrid context of the use. The powerful capabilities of Tourism 4.0 technologies allow for the enhancement of interaction with a system and enrichment of the tourist experience itself, providing new ways of assisting in behavior change and even in the long-lasting transformation of the users. However, this also means greater potential for harm. This viewpoint conceptualizes three different effects of interactive system use on technology-mediated tourist experiencesbesides goal achievement that impacts satisfaction, effects can be goal-limiting (ranging from distracting to damaging) or goal-surpassing (ranging from enhancing to transforming). This conceptualization is then used to frame the importance of human-centered design for emerging Tourism 4.0 technologies.',\n",

The questionnaire\\'s reliability was tested using factor analysis and internal consistency analysis. The results showed that managers still have insufficient knowledge concerning the impact of energy and its link to tourism. Additionally, 66.4% of the participants considered their knowledge regarding energy issues in tourism to be poor or negligible. It can be concluded that continued education for managers is required as higher awareness leads to \"greener\" attitudes among managers in tourism.',\n",

This study assesses the tourism potential of two almost depopulated villages in Serbia, Gostua (Pirot) and Poganovo (Dimitrovgrad), and identifies their second-home tourism perspectives. They have similar geo-demographic characteristics, but different development patterns. A practical understanding of residents' perception was gained along with identifying the socio-economic indicators. A comprehensive comparison is made to identify the diversification level of the rural economy in these villages. The study also assesses the rural capital and concludes that it is not realistic to expect fast and sustainable tourism development in these peripheral rural areas. Finally, the study extracts the factors of influence and predicts trends of the diversification process and second-home tourism expansion in rural areas of Balkan Mt.\",\n",
              " 'This research aims to extend the model of goal-directed behavior, by deepening its emotional path and including new variables to predict tourist behavioral intention: hedonism, destination experience, and tourism innovativeness. Based on a final sample of 457 European tourist nationals, the findings showed the significant influence of hedonism and tourism innovativeness on tourist desire. In addition, findings uncover the mediating role of hedonism on the emotional path. The findings also extend previous research by revealing that not all destination experience dimensions (sensory, affective, behavioral, and intellectual) equally influence tourist behavioral intention. Indeed, only sensory and intellectual destination experience dimensions were found to affect behavioral intention. The findings have important implications for tourism managers crafting destination experiences and contribute to tourism research by presenting a more comprehensive framework of goal-directed behavior applied to tourism.',\n",

It is necessary to explore the degree of coordination and coupling between the cultural industry and the tourism industry in ethnic minority areas and find ways to promote the coordinated development of the two industries. Methods/Statistical Analysis: This study selected Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region as the sample, collected data from 2010 to 2018, and analyzed it based on the coupling coordination theory. Findings: The results revealed that the comprehensive development evaluation index of the cultural industry and the tourism industry basically showed a year-on-year upward trend, and the development speed of the cultural industry is slightly higher than that of the tourism industry; the coupling degree of the regional cultural industry and tourism industry was at a high level; the coordination degree of the two industries increased gradually from 0.3971 in 2010 to 0.9425 in 2018. It indicated that the coupling development of the two industries continues to improve. However, the development speed of tourism industry slightly was slower than the development speed of the cultural industry. Improvements: This study attempts to develop an index to evaluate the tourism and cultural industries in an ethnic minority region and assess the coupling and coordination degree through an empirical analysis. This study emphasizes the need to better understand the integration of the cultural industry and the tourism industry as a process to complement each other, which can produce a positive synergy effect to benefit both the economy and the environment. This paper also provides development suggestions for the culture and tourism industry stakeholders in other areas of the world from the perspective of open innovation.',\n",

The results show that international students can be considered as educational tourists, and their stay can benefit them and the destination. In this context, the university can actively facilitate relationships between tourists and local stakeholders to foster learning at the destination and improve the sustainability of the local economy; some reports about specific cases are described. We argue that the tourism component should be considered by any institution organising or managing educational programmes, in order to exploit the opportunities offered by the destination for the achievement of learning goals. More specifically, the paper focuses on educational tourism related to HEI students in international mobility programs, who are educational tourists inasmuch as their overall experience at the destination includes leisure and tourism activities. Further research is needed to formulate models of intervention.\",\n",

The purpose is to investigate how the specific personality traits of narcissism, locus of control, and the Big Five (i.e. extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, openness to experience) influence the tourism start-up entrepreneurs behaviour. After a review and assessment of the literature regarding entrepreneurs personality traits, the paper describes a quantitative analysis of eighty-nine Italian start-up entrepreneurs operating in the tourism sector. Two main results arose from the empirical analysis. Firstly, tourism entrepreneurs seem to be particularly narcissistic, extroverted and friendly (extraversion), disciplined (agreeableness), self-assured, efficient and organized (conscientiousness), unconventional (openness to experience), and proactive and vigorous (internal locus of control). Secondly, some personality traits are found to influence the efficiency and innovative capacity of entrepreneurs which ultimately lead to the success of start-ups. The paper further advances our understanding of tourism entrepreneurship by clarifying the relevance of specific personality traits that characterize start-up entrepreneurs in the tourism industry.',\n",

This article uses the Cittaslow's approach for enhancing sustainable intangible heritage tourism. The research team identified and interviewed all parties involved in the safeguarding of local intangible heritage, such as custodians, practitioners, residents, companies and visitors. Our premise is that sustainable intangible heritage tourism should focus on finding synergistic balance and alignment between the interests of diverse stakeholders. We surveyed tourist visitors about their interests in and perceptions of local intangible heritage. Local residents were also surveyed about their feelings concerning intangible heritage tourism. The views of custodians, practitioners and entrepreneurs were gauged by using in-depth interviews. In order to learn from experiences elsewhere in the Netherlands, we also analysed best practices in intangible heritage tourism, which were applicable to Eijsden-Margraten. Our research findings enabled us to develop four recommended intangible heritage related attractions and events: a heritage experience museum; workshops; a regional products day; and a spectacle. The various stakeholders can develop each of these together in order to attract intangible heritage tourism. These recommended activities should produce year-round intangible heritage tourism in Eijsden-Margraten, ultimately strengthening small-scale sustainable tourism.\",\n",
              " 'The article analyzes the impact of cultural tourism on the development of municipalities in depressed regions through case-study of the small town Plyos in Ivanovo oblast in Russia. The town-planning composition of Plyos is determined by the Volga river and the complex highly rugged relief. The unique combination of architecture and natural landscape makes the town and its surroundings attractive for cultural tourism development. The connection between the development of culture and tourism in Plyos has been noted since the beginning of the 1970s. Since then, from decade to decade, these spheres have constantly strengthened each other\\'s development. A number of market factors have been identified for effective involvement of historical heritage and cultural landscape in various types of cultural tourism and their transformation into a resource for sustainable development of the settlement. These market factors can be summarized into three groups: marketing, institutional and investment. The bet on market-based and diversified development of cultural tourism made by the authorities of the municipality and the region in 2005 has produced significant positive results by 2020. The structure of cultural tourism in Plyos has changed qualitatively, and the importance of event and creative tourism has grown significantly. Over the past 4-5 years, the tourist flow has changed radically in the direction of a significant increase in the share of individual and most solvent categories of tourists. Increasing the duration of cruise ship stay and lengthening the period of attendance in Plyos for individual tourists provides an increase in the load of tourist infrastructure in the summer season, and the boom in expensive seasonal real estate and the expansion of the offer of services for types of tourism related to cultural, contribute to leveling the seasonal load. However, these successes have a downside, when Plyos is an \"island of prosperity\"in the \"economic desert\"of its depressed regional environment. There are several ways in which it is possible to influence the development of a depressive surroundings. For the Ivanovo region, Plyos acts as a \"point of entry\"for investments in the tourism sector, a promoter of all-Russian events in the field of cultural tourism and a market place for products of local producers, including products of world-famous art crafts.',\n",

On this basis, this study will optimize the spatial network of tourism. The results in this study show that: (1) In terms of supply side and demand side, the tourist attractions in Xinjiang all present a clustered distribution trend. Compared with the space of scenic areas on supply side, that on demand side has a smaller distribution range. And they are concentrated along Tianshan Mountain and in the northern region of Altay; (2) In Xinjiang, the accessibility of tourist attractions is poor, and tourist attractions on demand side is slightly higher than that on supply side; (3) In the system of tourism network space on supply and demand side, the tourism scenic areas in Xinjiang have the phenomenon of stratified clustering, and there is a significant trend of cohesion development; (4) According to the identification results of supply-side and demand-side tourism spatial structure, this study will integrate the core tourist attractions, build and improve their traffic system of roads, so as to construct a 'Three-axis, Four-core and Four-group' tourism spatial network. At the same time, this study will provide a new idea for the identification and optimization of regional tourism spatial structure, so as to provide a scientific reference for the construction of tourist attractions, the design of tourist routes and the integration of tourism resources.\",\n",

              " 'The main lever for the development and promotion of rural tourism in Greece has been, and continues to be, through specific EU programmes. Rural tourism in Greece began with a long delay compared to other European countries. The development philosophy was (and still is) to increase rural incomes as a complement to agricultural and livestock production, not by degrading them. This theoretical paper presents previous research studies in rural tourism and EU development programmes and it describes how European financial tools intended for rural tourism were implemented in Greece. Furthermore, it describes the challenges faced by rural people involved in the development of rural tourism in seeking European funding through a multi-layer approach on the obstacles in the EU funds absorption capacity. The analysis shows that the legislation, design of the programmes, processes from local governments, bureaucracy and malpractices create constraints in the absorption of EU funds and the results in the rural tourism development are not the expected ones. It concludes that there is a need for reforms in the national institutional framework and structures along with a different philosophy in approaching the EU funding initiatives in rural areas.',\n",

The study involved three steps. The first step was a critical reflection on sustainable tourism indicators and DPSIR as a grouping approach. The analysis yielded 29 sustainability indicators distributed within four components of the DPSR framework. The data were collected for 54 NUTS 2 level MED regions. In the second step, an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) followed by a cluster analysis (CA) were performed to group homogenous regions and generate the Med Regions Cluster Matrix (MRCM). The investigation revealed that although countries in the Mediterranean share many characteristics in terms of tourism development and impacts, universal policies in mitigating the pressures are not appropriate. The main contributions of the study are (1) the application of the DPSIR model in the sustainable tourism context (2) and the analysis of the similarities and differences regarding the sustainability of tourism development in the selected MED regions. The conclusions of the analysis may stimulate the debate on mutual responses and sustainable tourism policy responses in the MED region.',\n",

The current state of knowledge does not inform us how this change has impacted senior tourism demand and industry. Additional pension income may relax budget constraints and provide an opportunity to fulfill a desired level of tourism. For disadvantaged elderly, however, its impact on tourism choice is not clear because of consumption needs for other necessities and limited mobility. This study examines a recent social pension reform in South Korea to study the impact of old-age income security on tourism demand. We find that a doubling of public pension benefits is associated with an average of 2359.5% increase in travel frequency and 5296% rise in travel spending among benefit-eligible seniors. These results suggest that pension reforms aiming to improve old-age income security will have a positive influence on the tourism and hospitality industry.',\n",

Our research showed that the study of postmodern causes apart from classic ones holds unique potential in the research of sustainable tourism processes as well. The results of cross-tabulation and correspondence analysis show that postmodern and classic causes are tightly connected to lifestyle, which represents the central theme of the current study based on the results of a Hungarian representative online survey. Acertain limitation is that our research is based on the case of Hungary; however, the introduced methodology can be used in general for identifying and evaluating non-travelers. As research implications, the authors believe that the methodology and results can be used by the actors of the tourism supply market and by decision makers as well, especially for segmenting purposes. If we understand who the non-tourists or non-travelers are, we can, on the one hand, determine the latent tourism potential of a tourism destination; on the other hand, we can also receive information on specific market segments, which could contribute to sustainable tourism mostly because of the postmodern causes for non-traveling.',\n",

The conceptual framework provides a holistic view for researchers and destination managers to examine diaspora tourism. It suggests that the demand dimension of diaspora tourism concerns the structure of diaspora communities; the diasporic individuals migration histories, acculturation level and sense of place will determine their motives to return; the destination dimension involves debates on the issues of why current diasporic destinations and their products may not be able to meet the needs of different types of tourists.

Therefore, heritage institutions such as the erfgoedcel have a unique role in promoting consciousness about what intangible cultural heritage is, why these practices are an important dimension of our cultural heritage and how each and every one of us keeps it alive just by going on holiday. Erfgoedcel Kusterfgoed believes that this institution-based approach creates opportunities to start a dialogue about this intangible heritage and can also serve as a way to address tourism in a more conscious and sustainable way.\",\n",
              " \"Tourism trips in New Zealand are strongly car-dominated. Research suggests that such car use practices do not only emerge from purely rational economic considerations but also result from symbolic and affective motives, institutionalized mobility cultures, and habitualized mobility practices that have developed and materialized in spatial structures over decades. This paper explores the notion of automobility and its influence on the domestic tourism mobilities of Christchurch residents. It does so by applying Q methodology, an inherently mixed method that involves participants structuring statements by their level of agreement, followed by a range of qualitative post-sorting questions. The statements draw on insights from the study of tourism mobilities, mobility cultures and classical mode choice research, allowing this study to provide novel insights into the under-researched field of urban-rural tourism mobility. The juxtaposition of quantitative Q and the qualitative interview results reveals influential factors at the personal, interpersonal, societal/political and infrastructural level. The results then feed into a conceptualisation of influential factors of tourism mobility choices using an embedded, interlinked structure that captures the dynamics of social interactions (i.e., feedback-loops). Policy implications are discussed with regards to possible sustainability pathways in line with New Zealand's decarbonisation strategy.\",\n",
              " \"Tourism plays a crucial role in alleviating poverty deprivations and achieving sustainable development. Nevertheless, there is a lack of literature regarding evaluating poor residents' perceptions of the impacts of tourism on poverty alleviation from the perspective of multidimensional poverty. Taking Fenghuang County, China, as the study area, this study established an evaluation framework by using the Delphi method based on multidimensional poverty theory. Moreover, analytic hierarchy process (AHP) was employed to identify the weight of each indicator and assess poor residents' perceptions of the impacts of tourism on poverty alleviation. The results indicate that tourism economic development has been a momentous contributor to alleviating multidimensional poverty in study locations to a certain extent (3.180). However, there is still room for improvement and promotion. With respect to various dimensions, the mean of economic level is the highest (1.125), whilst the means of education training (0.420) and health care (0.819) are relatively lower than the other dimensions.\",\n",
              " 'This conceptual paper explores theoretical linkages between scientific tourism and sustainability outcomes within indigenous communities. Drawing on sustainability science, boundary work theory, indigenous knowledge, and decolonial frameworks, we present a typology of scientific tourism situations mapped according to the degree in which they allow co-production of solutions that combine indigenous and scientific knowledge. This paper is based on the premise that co-produced solutions are essential for sustainability outcomes and they require effective boundary organizations capable of translating and coordinating across cultural paradigms. Two approaches to scientific tourism that can facilitate sustainability outcomes, particularly in indigenous communities, are proposed. The first approach is endogenous to the academy and requires cognition of knowledge plurality and researcher reflexivity. The second is exogenous to the academy and entails boundary organizations as well as tools and strategies necessary for horizontal co-production. Implications for future scholarship on scientific tourism in marginalized and/or global south communities are discussed. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

Four exogenous sectors are chosen for this investigation: Federal Government, construction, manufacturing, and tourism. Perhaps unsurprisingly, evidence suggests that a larger share of Federal Government employment in an economy reduces the variability of overall employment growth, while a larger share of construction activity elevates it. More telling is a finding that, recently, manufacturing has not contributed as much to such variability, and that a larger tourism presence increases it. The increasing integration of technology in tourism offers significant opportunities for a network approach and innovation in regional development.',\n",

Tourism, as understood as a sociocultural phenomenon, is a special manifestation of location. In addition to the motives for undertaking trips in martial arts tourism, individual destinations, specific tourism potential and the typology of participants in tourist meetings were analyzed, and individual cases were examined. The research materials were 44 articles published in scientific journals indexed in Scopus, Web of Science, and EBSCOHost databases. Publications, which appeared in the sources discussed between 2005 and mid-2020s were considered. Some periodicals were present in all three of the quoted databases, therefore specific articles were taken into account only once. This study will cover a meta-analysis of martial arts tourism in journals indexed in several major scientific databases. It is related to the phenomenon of tourism of this type, which is discussed from various scientific perspectives. As a research tool, the Atlas. ti program was used (mainly in the qualitative research or analysis of qualitative data), by means of which correlations and dominant items were sought. A comparison with other publications suggests that no similar meta-analysis has so far been performed in relation to the literature devoted to the subject of \"martial arts tourism\". Particularly interesting conclusions were identified: (1) there are thematic relations between the destination country, the main destination, and the destination country; (2) martial arts are treated by researchers as both primary, and secondary threads, (3) the difference between travel destinations and types events attended by people interested in martial arts, (4) the variety of event formats plays a role in popularizing the subject of these forms of physical activity, and (5) the number of publications describing specific destinations is not particularly related to specific countries as destinations.',\n",

There is unprecedented availability of open and big data, and there are rapid developments in intelligence gathering and the application of analytical tools. While cultural heritage holds many tangible and intangible values for local communities and society in general, there is a knowledge gap regarding suitable methods and data sources to measure the impacts and develop data-driven policies of cultural tourism. In the tourism sector, rapid developments are particularly taking place around novel uses of mobile positioning data, web scraping, and open application programming interface (API) data, data on sharing, and collaborative economy and passenger data. Based on feedback from 15 European cultural tourism regions, recommendations are developed regarding the use of innovative tools and data sources in tourism management. In terms of potential analytical depth, it is especially advisable to explore the use of mobile positioning data. Yet, there are considerable barriers, especially in terms of privacy protection and ethics, in using such data. User-generated big data from social media, web searches, and website visits constitute another promising data source as it is often publicly available in real time and has low usage barriers. Due to the emergence of new platform-based business models in the travel and tourism sector, special attention should be paid to improving access and usage of data on sharing and collaborative economy.',\n",

However, the management of the administrative and financial processes of this type of enterprise was unknown. In this sense, this paper aims to analyze the state of these processes within the so-called Community-Based Tourism Enterprises (CBTEs) in the provinces of Pichincha, Napo, and Imbabura (Ecuador). For this purpose, a matrix was designed to collect information on the administrative and financial processes that an enterprise should have, detailing all their elements with their respective assessment. Also, an interview was administered to the 28 community leaders (one for each CBTE) to diagnose each issue of business management. In this diagnosis, it was concluded that, despite having a certificate from the Ministry of Tourism (MINTUR), the Community-Based Tourism Enterprises have not implemented important administrative and financial processes such as a strategic plan, operational plan, market study, cost analysis, process manual, market plan, initial situation, results status, final status, or financial indicators. Therefore, in the long term, this leads to poor management of business resources, which can result in the closure of these enterprises.',\n",

This paper investigates how hosting a mega sports event such as the 2016 Rio Games-Olympic and Paralympic influence the Rio de Janeiro and Brazil image' like popular destinations among tourists. Objectives. The following hypotheses guided our research to identify the more positive image of Brazil as a tourism destination. Methods. A mixed research design combining both qualitative and quantitative approaches was used. Participants were recruited at the Technische Universitat Munchen and in the city center of Munich, Germany. The two dimensions (cognitive and affective) of the tourism destination image were considered to elaborate a questionnaire survey, which mixes both qualitative and quantitative methods. Results. The significant factors influencing the intentions of a person to attend the Games in Brazil are the positive portrayed image of the country and their sport interest. According to the multiple regression conducted, the only variables, which have influenced people's intention to go to Brazil for the Olympics, were the image of the country as a tourism destination ( = 0.404, p < 0.05) and sports interests ( = 0.259, p < 0.05). The same influence of these variables was observed when the independent variable is the intention to go for the Paralympics: an image of Brazil as a tourism destination ( = 0.377, p < 0.05) and sports interest ( = 0.205, p < 0.05) have influenced respondent's intention. Conclusions. Furthermore, the study revealed the hosting of the Olympic Games had a more considerable influence on a person's intentions to visit the country than the hosting of Paralympic Games.

While prior studies converge toward the idea that immersion is a critical dimension of the tourism experience, research on immersion remains scarce, particularly the conditions under which immersion is achieved and its consequences on visitor evaluations. To fill this gap, this research builds on the experiential and flow literature to propose a model where immersion derives from autonomy and leads to greater visitor satisfaction through the underlying mechanism of temporal dissociation. Additionally, it is proposed that reactance moderates the relationship between autonomy and temporal dissociation.

This study aims to determine the points of interest of urban residents by analyzing big data from search engines to reveal the physical characteristics of POIs. To achieve this, POI data were collected in three city centers in Seoul using a South Korean dominant portal site that includes a search engine. The most popular POIs were determined by using GIS search engine analysis frequency, and correlation and regression analyses were conducted to investigate the relation between POIs and urban elements. The results revealed different POI trends in each city center. While POIs were concentrated in old, narrow streets with small attractions and mixed-use construction near Seoul City Wall (historic downtown district), they also formed around notable architectural landmarks in the newly developed Yeouido and Yeongdeungpo areas. This study found that tourism attraction took different forms in old and new areas, demonstrating that citizens are interested in both historic downtown areas and new areas, as traditional urban theorists suggest. Thus, urban planners and tourism policy makers should consider specific spatial contexts with search engines.',\n",

              " \"Currently, information technology plays an important role in the tourism industry. Tourists like to use social media more widely for their travel planning, which affects the high competition between entrepreneurs while facing the challenge of improving the quality of data services provided through social media. This study developed a model of the relationships between structure factors that affect intentions to use social media for travel planning. The said model integrates the technology acceptance model (TAM) theory, the theory of planned behavior (TPB), and trust and satisfaction factors. In reference to a survey of 1333 samples from domestic tourists who used social media through their smartphone, it was found that satisfaction, attitudes, subjective norms, and perception can be used to control behavior, with a positively direct effect on intentions of use. In addition, we examined the indirect effect on intentions of use. Perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and subjective norms had a positively significant indirect effect on intentions of use. These research results allow tourism entrepreneurs to precisely understand the stimulating factors of tourists' intentions to use social media for travel-planning decisions, which will help lead to the development of tourism-marketing strategies and the support of sustainable competition.\",\n",
              " 'This article begins with the view that the research of accessible tourism should not only find justification for increasing demand but also have the ultimate purpose of seeking justice for an equitable society. To this end, prior research on accessible tourism is theoretically outlined, and the concepts, causes, and aspects of disability discrimination are considered. In addition, cases of discrimination of customers with disabilities in the tourism and hospitality industries are investigated by an ethnographic approach. The findings are categorized into seven sections, depending on the type of lack of understanding of customers with disabilities. In other words, service providers have a stereotypical view that customers with disabilities have similar attributes, and they also fail to free customers with disabilities from the prejudice of customers with nondisabilities, who may generalize the group with disabilities with a negative and hostile attitude. Additionally, tourist attractions, lodging, and dining infrastructure have caused a stigma that lowers the activities of customers with disabilities to bystanders or makes customers with disabilities more recognized as a social protection target rather than members of society. Therefore, marketing implications can be discussed in terms of physical facilities and human services at the key points where discrimination against customers with disabilities occurs, as can be seen from the results of this study.',\n",

In fact, the current moment of health, economic, and social crisis that we are experiencing seems to be no exception. Tourism seems to be one of the most affected activities by the COVID-19 pandemic crisis-due not only the cancelled flights but also to the fear of being infected with the virus. In this sense, the present article intends to identify the Azores Archipelago residents' tourism expectations during the COVID-19 crisis. Using the Azores Islands as a case study and merging it with the authors' knowledge about this regional reality, it was possible to collect a substantial quantity of data. Thus, this study provides an in-depth perception of the main issues about how this pandemic crisis affects the tourism expectations of the Azores region residents, and consequently, how this situation will influence regional sustainable development. Through the study, it was possible to verify that the significant part of the Azores Archipelago residents (57.5%) will not be going to travel to spend vacations in 2020. Additionally, 84.2% will have holidays in the region; therefore, they stay in the Azores Archipelago. Besides, this study shows that majority of the respondents (61.6%) would not make a reservation for a 2020 vacation.\",\n",
              " 'Poor mental health costs about a tenth of global GNP. For many people, nature exposure improves mental health. This generates a newly recognised health service value for national parks worldwide, estimated at trillions of dollars annually. It creates a correspondingly large potential new market for commercial nature tourism, as a provider of nature therapies, especially in national parks. Before this opportunity can be realised, however, we must establish whether voluntary park visits generate mental health gains for everyone. Currently, psychology researchers and protected area managers hold opposing views. I therefore interviewed 238 outdoor nature and adventure tourists of all ages and backgrounds, at subtropical national parks in Queensland, Australia, to determine whether they visit parks because they are happy, or they are happy because they visit parks. A large majority, 82%, picked the latter. Of those asked, 87.5% reported short-term emotional benefits; 60%, medium-term recovery from stress; and 20%, long-term changes in worldview. Each timescale corresponds to a different opportunity for commercial nature tourism. Future research priorities include: economic scale; experiential components and commercial design for different market segments; comparisons of individual benefits for people with different personalities; and tests of mental health benefits for other types of tourism. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

              " 'This article demonstrates that ethnic tourism offers an important opportunity for the tourist marketing of highly diverse neighbourhoods that were formerly known as \"problem areas.\" Ethnic tourism also offers the prospect of safeguarding intangible heritage in a highly diverse context, for which Steven Vertovec coined the concept of \\'superdiversity\\', to refer to current levels of population diversity that are significantly higher than before. Conurbations such as The Hague and Rotterdam are committed to ethnic tourism for economic development and to the enhancement of the quality of life in these formerly deprived neighbourhoods. It is an international trend, which can be seen in all major superdiverse cities in Western Europe. We show that ethnic entrepreneurs play a key role in these processes. They bring economic development by attracting ethnic tourists even from countries outside Europe. We illustrate these processes via examples, learnt from City Silks in The Hague, which attract customers from as far away as Morocco for its ethnic wedding costumes, and from Bharat Lachmansingh in Rotterdam, which has been selling traditional and ritual products for 37 years from the Surinamese/Indian culture, with clients from countries such as Belgium, Germany, France and England in addition to the local Surinamese/Indian population. We demonstrate that these ethnic entrepreneurs fulfil the role of \\'cultural brokers\\', as \\'custodians\\' of intangible heritage. As experts in traditions, these entrepreneurs provide information, sell products that are indispensable for the practice of this intangible heritage and are often involved in organizing intangible heritage events. In this sense, they contribute to safeguarding intangible cultural heritage. We also demonstrate that these ethnic neighbourhoods present themselves as meaningful places where one can see and experience various forms of intangible heritage. It is demonstrated that there are various tensions in these processes. Between commerce and culture, between tourism and heritage, between safeguarding intangible heritage and economic development, and last but not least, between various stakeholders, for example residents of a neighbourhood, ethnic entrepreneurs, tourism industry, area developers and city governments. One issue especially addressed is the challenge of folklorisation. It is undeniable that festival-like forms such as Chinese New Year and Keti Koti are brought forward as powerful markers of a neighbourhood, and such festivals may also be of interest to tourists. But it is also shown that the marketing of \"authentic\" intangible heritage has its limits, and that this kind of branding can also lead to folklorisation, often referred to all the challenge of \\'Disneyfication\\'. It may attract new tourists but does not always benefit the communities.',\n",

Experiences and memories of communism between 1944 and 1991 together with current touring performances of communist remnants are heterogeneously connected in a multidirectional network. Via the rhizome we explore this network as shifting connectivity rather than a confined and permanent construct. Thus, locals' post/communist experiences are roots and shoots which associate with other elements of the past, and with tourists' heterogeneous performances of communist places. We, therefore, explain ambivalences towards communist heritage and simultaneous dis/inheritance through tourism in these places.\",\n",

              " 'This essay analyses diaspora tourism in Ireland today. Is this an example of instrumentalization of intangible heritage for economic purposes only? Or does the local community benefit from such diaspora strategies as well? The essay offers an in-depth study of policy documents and manuals, supplemented with conversations with Irish colleagues, and an analysis of the Donegal Connects festival. The discourse of the diaspora strategy is often very emotional as it refers to a sense of belonging and the search for a rooted identity. Is the decentral approach of the Irish policy striking? It supports local heritage communities to develop projects that truly meet their needs. I argue that intangible heritage benefits from this approach. Firstly, because locals (re)discover the meaning and value of the heritage in their own region. Moreover, by connecting these local groups to an international diaspora, the heritage community is widened. As such the tension between \"host\" and \"guest\" disappears, as locals and diaspora-members become partners in co-creative processes. In this long-term relationship-building engagement is central, a concept that is further elaborated in this essay in five sub-types: emotional, effort, cognitive, social and innovative engagement. The Irish diaspora strategy triggers these five types. It lifts abandoned villages out of isolation and contributes to improving the local quality of life. Moreover, it guarantees that the care for heritage can continue, even if the support of the government should be reduced. In Ireland, diaspora tourism is an ally for enabling sustainable heritage development. It is based on feelings of connection and triggers a strong form of engagement. The policy builds international heritage communities that take care of and safeguard the heritage together. Or, to put it in the words of the Irish minister of Diaspora: \"diaspora tourism is more than a resource, it\\'s a community\".',\n",

Usually, researchers conduct this test in various popular establishments where devices are intended for experimental use and tourists are supposed to have previous exposure to them, so that their perceptual thinking regarding the service quality of these devices can be studied. The tourists act as respondents for various establishments. We also asked subjective questions in a short interview to 10 professionals working in these establishments, which helped us in the quantitative survey process. As a mixed method study, it has covered both quantitative and qualitative aspects of the items and provided a holistic result. The results indicated thatWeb 4.0 and 5.0, along with the service quality offered by personnel working in the establishments, showed significant variance in holistic service evaluation for tourist satisfaction and loyalty. Very few service quality factors had a distinct variance in the output. After using a regression analysis for Web 4.0 and 5.0 devices and service quality, we found that Web 4.0 and 5.0 showed insignificant negative results.

A media analysis was conducted of 507 online media articles on overtourism in Iceland that were published in 2018, with the main themes being identified via content analysis. The results indicated that the media discourse represented only a partial picture of overtourism and the crowding phenomenon in Iceland, with mechanisms to respond to crowding, the satisfaction level of tourists with their Icelandic nature experience, and local people's support for tourism being underreported. Some of the findings reflect that of other media analyses. However, there are considerable discontinuities between media representations and discourses of overtourism in Iceland, which highlight the importance of national-or destination-level media analysis.

Trip chain and travel mode choices as well as their interplays are crucial in analysing and understanding the travel behaviour of tourists, which can help to address these problems. Therefore, this study explored the relationship between destination transportation modes and trip chain choices using nested logit models wherein two nest structures were used to analyse the decision processes of travellers. Empirical analysis confirmed the effectiveness of the rational model using survey data collected from 350 respondents in Nanjing, China in 2020. The results showed that tourists preferred deciding on the trip chain prior to the travel mode, and higher time and costs were acceptable when tourists selected a complex trip chain with tour activities. Moreover, non-local tourists owning a driver's licence, travelling with companions, and staying for longer periods were more likely to use public transport with trip chains comprising tour activities; however, the relationship for trip chains with non-tour activities was the reverse. These findings are valuable for designing effective transport management strategies to ease traffic during holiday periods.\",\n",

In Hong Kong, where tourism is a pillar industry, the hotel industry is essential to maintaining a stable economy. Facing multiple forms of pressure, the industry's status deserves close attention. More than 200 hotels in Hong Kong were taken as the research set in this study. A Python-based web crawler was used to collect daily hotel prices from various online travel agencies. Repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and descriptive analysis were employed to study hotels' room rate fluctuations over time. Results indicated that room rates across hotels in Hong Kong were primarily influenced by holidays and festivities prior to COVID-19, whereas rates tended to decline after the outbreak. Data analysis based on hotels' star ratings revealed that 5-star hotels were relatively less affected by COVID-19 while 4- and 4.5-star hotels were most seriously affected. District-level analysis also showed that hotel room rates were differentially influenced by the virus: Hong Kong's Islands district was hit hardest, followed by Kowloon.

Secondly, it examines the level of local participation and inclusiveness through a case study of the Udawalawe National Park. A value chain-based methodology is employed to estimate the local economic share of the park value chain. Results indicate that factors affecting inclusiveness such as human capital, financial capital, social capital, gender, location, level of complementarity between tourism and local livelihoods, and absence of endogenous growth policies have limited both local participation and their share in a park's value chain. This indicates the need for revenue sharing and integrated tourism cluster development programmes to offset costs and risks of locals, and to improve local attitudes towards conservation.\",\n",
              " \"Online shopping has tremendous growth nowadays. Concerns about whether people perceive food souvenirs as commercial goods or products with local connections arise when shopping online for those souvenirs. Another concern is whether people remain interested in knowing or visiting places where food souvenirs originate even if they can simply purchase food souvenirs online. These issues are important for the sustainable development of local tourism. This study aims to investigate consumers' motivations for purchasing food souvenirs online and whether diff;erences exist between segmented consumers in relation to their travel-related intentions. Participants of this work are individuals who have purchased food souvenirs online and are aged 18 years old or above. Social media applications, such as Facebook and Line, were utilized as the platforms for the questionnaire survey. Participants' motivations for purchasing food souvenirs online included five factors: exploring trends, local affliations, social interactions, frugal sampling, and enforcing relationships. According to their motivations, participants were segmented into four types of consumers, including pleasure reminiscers (47.0%), journey recallers (22.9%), economical tasters (17.4%), and social practicers (12.7%). Pleasure reminiscers have stronger intentions toward searching for information on, traveling to, and recommending the places where food souvenirs originate compared with the other three types of consumers. On the basis of the findings, suggestions for the design and marketing of food souvenirs are provided for the producers of food souvenirs and promoters of local tourism.\",\n",

Methods and structure of the study. The experiment involved the 18-23 year-old students of Ammosov North-Eastern Federal University (n=12). During the experiment, we conducted a questionnaire survey using such methodologies as \"Group atmosphere\" and \"Interpersonal relationships in a team and team motivation\", which enabled to identify such problem as low self-esteem. The emotional atmosphere in the team was characterized by irritation, negativity, tension, and indifference. Based on the results of the questionnaire survey, we built a rafting route on the Sinyaya and Lena rivers. At the same time, we considered the harsh natural conditions of the area: hot summers with peak temperatures, cold rains, numerous mosquitoes, midges. The work on team cohesion consisted in such joint activities as assembly and disassembly of camping tents, catamarans, equipment maintenance, cooking for the entire team, scheduled duties, participation in competitions, and group quizzes. The subjects were divided into 2 groups (catamarans), people each. Results of the study and conclusions. During the experiment, the participants learned each others individual characteristics and character and began to communicate with each other in their spare time, and they developed a greater sense of cohesion and appreciation of teamwork.

              " \"The changing climate represents a large challenge for farmers, and adaptation responses are necessary to minimize impacts. Mixed approaches, which involve the analysis of meteorological data, web-based surveys, and face-to-face interviews, explore producers' barriers and pressing needs to enhance climate resilience based on the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) approach in semi-arid north-western China. According to the main categories of farming activity, 85 crop farmers, 68 animal farmers, and 81 agro-tourism operators were interviewed. We found that most of the producers perceived climate impacts, and they encountered multiple adaptation obstacles, of which institutional and normative obstacles were more serious, such as farmers unable to obtain resources or government incentives, lacked scientific, and efficient coping measures. The survey also observed that crop farmers had a pressing need for agricultural subsidies, while animal farmers and agro-tourism operators had a strong enabler for animal housing infrastructure and credit facilities, respectively. Given the heterogeneity of the context and climate change experience of different categories of farmers, it is necessary to formulate flexible adaptation strategies and adjust them according to specific climate stress and farming conditions. To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and implement the 2015 Paris Agreement, policymakers should plan and introduce appropriate adaptation strategies to minimize the adverse effects of climate change such as improving irrigation and weather forecasting system through technological advancement, cost reduction of farm inputs, ensuring availability of information, providing agricultural subsidies to the farmers, and increasing the access to agricultural markets.\",\n",

Yet examining fans' home lives also shows how they draw on exceptional practices to prepare for and memorialise the away match experience.

This paper finds that in practice, digital nomadism is not always experienced as autonomous and free but is a way of living that requires high levels of discipline and self-discipline. The research suggests that digital nomads often overlook the role of disciplining practices when first starting out, and do not foresee how working in sites of leisure and tourism might make managing a balance between work and non-work problematic. Longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork examines the extent of these disciplining practices and reveals that they are utilised to keep work and leisure time separate.',\n",

When proposing schemes for rural settlement, and promoting sustainable development and living conditions in rural areas, it is important both to explore long-term trends of evolution and predict trends of development. Remote sensing images are useful to this end, but most date no further back than the 1980s, thus making it difficult to describe the spatial evolution of rural settlements over longer periods. In view of this, this paper uses decrypted remote sensing data from the KeyHole military satellite on the Jizhou District of China, and pushes the interval back by 20 years (to 1962) to study the long-term evolution of the spatial pattern of rural settlements over a longer time scale. By setting different development scenarios, we use the Conversion of Land Use and its Effects at Small Region Extent (CLUE-S) model to simulate and predict the evolutionary trends of rural settlements in Jizhou District in 2030. The results show that the evolution of the spatial pattern of rural settlements in this area during 19622015 can be divided into three stages: From 1962 to 1980, the number of rural settlements decreased continually, their boundaries gradually became more regular, and they were randomly distributed throughout the study area. However, from 1980 to 2000, the number, area, and spatial morphological features of rural settlements did not change much compared to the other two periods. From 2000 to 2015, the number of settlements increased drastically, and the boundaries became irregular and were somehow centralized. The evolutionary trend of rural settlements was found to be different under different scenarios of development. In the new-type urbanization scenario, the total area of rural settlements was projected to decrease by 2.23%, and regions where urbanization had a strong influence on rural settlements were concentrated in the southern-central part of Jizhou District. Moreover, the rural settlements are converted mainly into urban land and other construction land. In the tourism development scenario, the total area of rural settlements increased by 7.89%, and regions where tourism had a strong influence on rural settlements were concentrated in the northern mountainous areas of Jizhou District.',\n",

Taking Gregory Bateson's concept of framing as a point of departure, and applying Erving Goffman's frame analysis, I will show that contemporary ayahuasca ceremonies attended by westerners are designed to be liminal, transformative, and meaningful experiences that aim to heal the body through emotional modulation. I will demonstrate how this is achieved through specific discourse that takes place before or during rituals in the form of long speeches delivered by the shamans. This framing not only separates the ritual space as liminal but also frames the way that the experience is conceptualized by the participants, ultimately increasing its meaningfulness.\",\n",

In the papers analysed, a relation was identified between geotourism and territorial development by benefits generated through this type of tourism at social and economic level. The bibliometric analysis also enabled us to identify clusters among the most cited authors that revealed some dominant themes and the relationship between the clusters. By studying the articles citation profile, this studys findings contribute to a better understanding of the flow of production interrelated geotourism with territorial development and research-related practices in this area of research.',\n",
              " \"Previous studies of forest transition (FT) have taken a narrow perspective. This paper aims to illustrate the crucial need for expanding the analytic scope of FT using China's experience during the past five decades. Afforestation and reforestation efforts have increased the country's forest cover remarkably, but the condition of China's forests remains disappointing if we look at changes in the stocking level, growth rate, age structure, species composition, and other indicators, even though progress has been made in certain aspects. It is thus premature to declare that China has completed its FT. There remains a long way for the country to go in boosting its forest quality, diversity, and productivity. Further, examining China's FT should also capture other relevant trends of forestry, including the rapid growths in the economies of non-timber forest products and forest-based tourism and recreation, as well as a large part of the timber resource consumed being imported from overseas destinations.\",\n",
              " 'This article argues that the curation of particular geopolitical imaginaries of Israel/Palestine for international tourists can legitimize and naturalize the violence of the Israeli state project. Juxtaposing the cases of Tel Aviv-Jaffa and the West Bank, I analyze the discourses and embodied practices that produce imaginative geographies through processes of spatial distancing and temporal fixing. The dominant imaginary in Tel Aviv-Jaffa incorporates Israel into a westernized geography of Europe, while the dominant imaginary of the West Bank emphasizes its location in an Orientalized Middle East. The cultivation of these tourist landscapes as entirely disparate places works to obscure how both are constitutive of a single Israeli regime, contributing to the public secret that separates the occupation of the West Bank from Israel as a democratic state. By examining how seemingly apolitical tourist practices are entangled with geopolitical violence, this article reveals the complicity of international tourism in sustaining Israeli settler colonial dispossession and military occupation.',\n",
              " 'The mitigation of spatiotemporal pressure is directly related to improvements for the competitive positions of coastal tourist destinations. Extensive diversification initiatives have been undertaken in many regions in order to achieve this goal. Despite the importance of specific spatiotemporal features of tourism, they have yet to be adequately integrated into existing studies that evaluate the comparative performance of destinations. To fill this gap, this paper uses a non-parametric data envelopment analysis method and builds a synthetic index of spatiotemporal efficiency in order to evaluate the performance of 37 Mediterranean coastal regions. In addition, it uses a bootstrapped truncated regression model to test the effects of product and spatial diversification on the spatiotemporal performance of destinations. The results suggest that both product and spatial diversification may enhance the spatiotemporal efficiency of destinations. Finally, they demonstrate that the easing of spatiotemporal pressures bears a real cost in terms of lost overnight stays that vary across different Mediterranean destinations based on unique local factors. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",
              " 'This paper applies the Event Experiences Scale (EES) to seven cultural events in different countries with the aim of identifying generic dimensions of event experience. Exploratory factor analysis indicated the presence of four experience dimensions: cognitive engagement, affective engagement, physical engagement and novelty. These broadly reflect the four dimensions found in the original EES study [de Geus, S., Richards, G., & Toepoel, V. (2016). Conceptualisation and operationalisation of event and festival experiences: Creation of an event experience scale. Scandinavian Journal of Hospitality and Tourism, 16(3), 274296]. In the cultural events analysed here, the cognitive dimension is strongest, followed by affective engagement, novelty and finally physical engagement. The experience dimensions are shown to vary significantly between visitor groups (particularly in terms of age) and by event location or context. Analysis of social media use shows that experiences also vary significantly through the stages of the event journey, with affective engagement being particularly prominent during and after the event.',\n",

This study uses the well-established Event Experience Scale (EES) developed by the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education and Research (ATLAS) event experience project, to explore attendees affective engagement in a multinational context and across various types of events (N = 852). The associations between visitors affective engagement in event experiences and their propensity to visit the destination and recommend the event to others are also explored and verified. The results highlight the importance of affective engagement in shaping attendees future behavioural intentions. Excitement was the most powerful predictor of intentions to recommend and revisit an event. The results also indicate the heterogeneity of perceptions of the different dimensions of affective engagement at different types of events. We suggest new possibilities for event organisers to plan and design different types of events that will generate higher levels of affective engagement and increase loyalty.',\n",

The objective of this paper is to propose and empirically test a model that captures relationships between two dimensions of IMC, i.e. consistency and interactivity, and two critical variables in destination branding literature, i.e. city reputation and consumer brand engagement (CBE). CBE has been considered a multi-dimensional construct composed of cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions. The findings reveal that both IMC consistency and IMC interactivity are highly influential on city reputation. However, IMC interactivity is found to exert a more significant role in the development of CBE than IMC consistency does. In addition, CBE is found to be affected by city reputation. The model has further been examined from a gender perspective through a multi-group analysis. Female tourists are found to be more sensitive to city reputation, while males are more influenced by IMC interactivity.',\n",

Using a positive psychology perspective as a guide for understanding the relationships between tourists and their interactions with creative tourist attractions, this study attempts to detect the positive effects of creative leisure travel experience on positive emotions, behavioral intentions and subjective well-being. Based on Self Determination Theory, this study investigates whether psychological needs satisfaction can be derived from a tourism environment that provides opportunities to experience positive emotions as well as enhances subjective well-being. The present study points to the importance of positive effects from creative leisure travel experience on subjective well-being by extending the research framework of SDT to incorporate the positive emotions perspective for understanding tourist experience. This study also confirms that psychological needs satisfaction acts as an important antecedent of behavioral intention to revisit creative tourist attractions.',\n",

Therefore, it is important that it can be quantified, considering the largest number of possible elements. In order not to compromise, the determination of these potential, subjective items should be avoided. The aim of this research was to develop a methodology based on a mathematical formula that can determine the touristic potential value of interpretive trails in natural areas, relating to different environmental variables and their values. The methodology consisted of grouping elements (1-condition of trail, 2-components that increase value, 3-components that reduce value, 4-environmental quality of the trail, which increase the value of the tourism potential of the interpretive trail) relative to variables, determining criteria and setting punctuation to develop the mathematical formula. After developing the formula, a test was applied using the Tatu Trail at Prosa State Park, Campo Grande, MS.

              " \"The purpose of this paper is to examine the importance of exceeding the expectations of guests to generate greater satisfaction, in order to offer an unforgettable experience and generate more comments on the Web 2.0 in the context of tourism. Structural equation models were used. The data for the analysis were obtained from a sample of residents of the Maldonado-Punta del Este conurbation (Uruguay), who were asked about their last overnight stay. The proposed structural equation model was tested using the partial least square (PLS) technique. The results show that exceeding the expectations of guests is essential for the clients' experience and very important for the satisfaction with the stay at the hotel. The generation of online comments (electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM)) is also strongly influenced by emotional experiences. Exceeding the expectations of trained clients and surprising them with new services and experiences is the essence of luxury offers. The main practical implication is that exceeding expectations is the key to eWOM, and this means that managers must be involved in a perpetual process of service innovation.\",\n",

Therefore, determining how to perceive and identify the characteristics of persons visiting a locality attracted by its heritage is relevant for the purpose of better meeting their expectations and needs. This research focuses on understanding the perceptions, motivations, and satisfaction of women visiting Cordoba (Spain). Thus, on the basis of a questionnaire completed by women visiting Cordoba between the months of June and November 2019, statistical analysis was conducted. Using various multivalent case-grouping techniques, segments of tourists holding similar perceptions of cultural heritage were detected. Moreover, non-parametric statistical techniques highlighted significant differences between the valuations obtained in the various segments. This analysis exposed a segment of women who, known as absorptive tourists, are characterized by a high cultural motivation to visit the city of Cordoba linked to the heritage sites they have visited.

First, a questionnaire was prepared with the commonly used dimensions of traveller risk perception and verified through a preliminary survey. Then, a formal online questionnaire survey was carried out, receiving 860 valid questionnaires. The survey data were subject to analysis based on structural equation model (SEM). The results show that, under COVID-19, the traveller risk perception is negatively correlated with the willingness to travel, and the traveller familiarity with the destination regulated the negative correlation.

              " 'Certain historical processes and sign language ideologies have led to the dissemination of American Sign Language (ASL) signs throughout Southeast Asia via deaf education projects, international development interventions, and tourism, notably in Cambodia and Indonesia. These ideologies normalized attempts to develop standardised sign systems based on national spoken languages and the introduction of signs from foreign sign languages, especially ASL. This history has shaped and mobilized ideas among deaf sign language users about language contact, the spread of hegemonic national sign languages, and the vitality of sign languages outside of the US and western Europe. Some of these ideologies manifest in deaf signers concerns about the vitality of what are often perceived to be non-hegemonic sign languages (e.g., sign languages that are not ASL, Auslan, or BSL) and language practices. By examining discourses and practices in the context of encounters between deaf tourists and deaf leaders in Bali, this article approaches larger questions about the territorialization of sign languages, linguistic boundaries, language contact, and sign language vitality.',\n",

More importantly, the DD providers developed a unique BM characteristics, which contrary to early predictions, enabled them to proliferate post-recession and maintain their position. The current study uses the BM approach to observe the original dimensions and BM elements, to identify distinct characteristics of generic and niche DD providers, and to benchmark them against the established OTAs. The BM approach enhances the understanding of the overlooked niche DD providers within IDSs. Further, this article provides a comparison of the BM characteristics in IDSs to help facilitate the formulation of a unique value proposition for each of them.

This paper reviewed the scientific literature related to transport and infectious diseases to gain insights into managing such circumstances. The outcomes indicate that the transport sector has a two-fold role during the outbreak of infectious diseases: controlling the spread of infection and assessing the impact of reduced outdoor activities on the transport sector. It was found that local and international travel restrictions, if applied at the initial stages, are effective in controlling the spread of infectious disease; at a later stage, behavioral changes become prominent in limiting the spread. Further, the outbreaks resulted in a significant reduction in mobility, altering traffic patterns with lower peaks and improving traffic safety. The public transport mode share reduced considerably and people preferred cars and active modes. These changes also showed positive impacts on air pollution and water pollution. Further, the air transport and tourism sector were noted to be the hardest hit and will recover slowly. The outcomes from the review will be useful for planners and administrators in managing future emergency conditions better.\",\n",

In areas of high urban density located close to metropolitan cities, UPS are usually provided properly and efficiently. However, in less populated territories, lying in the periphery, significant problems and deficiencies are often encountered, being most evident in rural areas located on the administrative limits of a state or region. This paper seeks to analyze the management of UPS in the internal border area between two Spanish regions, Aragon and Catalonia. A total of 72 stakeholders (mayors and town clerks) from 49 river municipalities were involved in this study that employs a quantitative methodology (questionnaire). The perception that there are deficiencies to correct and a clear will to reach agreements and establish cooperation mechanisms is detected in many of the municipalities in the border area. A clear need to cooperate is also apparent in a series of priority UPS, including the promotion of river tourism, town access roads, urban collective passenger transport, and environmental protection.',\n",

Coastal populations and development are growing. Concurrently, global climate change will influence sea level rise, resulting in increased flooding, storm surge, and coastal erosion. Regional planners must prepare for sea level rise and develop adaptive solutions to maximize resiliency. Comprehensive coastal vulnerability mapping assessments (CVMA) can integrate social, economic, and physical vulnerability with spatial analysis of natural hazards for local place-based investigations. Public Participation Geographic Information Systems (PPGIS) are a potentially important tool for the spatial collection of stakeholder knowledge for CVMA. The objective of this study was to assess the locations of a range of landscape values, ecosystem services, and development preferences held and identified by the general public using PPGIS to determine if those valued locations are vulnerable to sea level rise. We found that PPGIS can be used to map a wide variety of landscape values and that they can be used to assess vulnerability to sea level rise. We conclude with a discussion on how to integrate PPGIS into participatory CVMA for sea level rise planning.',\n",

Among these, Asian geoparks have become an attractive destination for visitors to experience geological landscapes. To date, there are limited studies available on the environmental impacts of geotourism in Asian geoparks. Here, we present a quantitative review of 26 peer-reviewed publications on geotourism impacts in Asia and discuss how to minimise them. The majority of these studies (64%) originated in China and reports on observational research (68%) rather than experimental research (11%). Data were mainly qualitative (48%) rather than quantitative (19%). Impacts accrued from an inadequate provision of conservation measures and infrastructure (leading to soil erosion), associated agriculture and urbanization, a lack of legislative frameworks and a lack of knowledge of visitors and local communities on how to behave in sensitive geosites. Management measures that appear promising were discussed such as the establishment of frameworks and policies to govern geotourism development along with visitor education and the critical importance of systematic quantitative studies. Both should support the rapidly growing geotourism industry in the Asian region.',\n",
              " 'This paper aims to assess the vulnerability of coastal areas to sectoral pressures from maritime-related socio-economic activities. To do this, a DEA-based method is proposed to construct a synthetic index of anthropogenic vulnerability with which to rank European Atlantic Area countries and regions down to a regional scale below the national level. The set of indicators selected for this index focuses on five important vectors: marine spills, port activities, tourism, protection of natural areas, and water quality and waste management. The paper shows that, overall, the United Kingdom has the most vulnerable coast in Atlantic Europe, with Ireland showing the most resilient coast of all. Furthermore, the proposed method also allows one to identify peer groups with the same vulnerability pattern. Thus, policies aiming to reduce the vulnerability of a target region may be devised by focusing on the least vulnerable regions within the relevant group. The detailed analysis presented may help regional policy makers as a diagnostic tool to detect and assess vulnerability weaknesses so that they can design and carry out appropriate actions in line with integrated European coastal management policies.',\n",

It does so from the tour guides perspective based on a case study of Kaiping Diaolou and Villages, a World Cultural Heritage Site. Data were mainly collected via participant observations and semi-structured interviews. The findings show that while the identified OUV underlines the materiality of the heritage site with a Eurocentric view, the guides tend to go beyond the built heritage to emphasize the people and activities related to it, transmitting a sense of Chineseness and place. Such culturally specific heritage value construction is a co-constructive and dynamic process involving multiple stakeholders: The national state promotes nation-building via (world) heritage system, whereas local government, supported by local experts, underpins the World Heritage with locality, by which the heritage place is differentiated so as to make it attractive; trained with normative templates embedded in state heritage discourse, guides seem to have established a sense of heritage identity and place; for domestic tourists, the expression of Chineseness is culturally appropriate and acceptable, while their regional difference allows a comparison that highlights the locality of the heritage place.',\n",

These MPAs receive high anthropogenic pressure from coastal development, tourism, and fishing, all in synergy with climate change. To contribute to the MPAs' effectiveness, it is necessary to provide a long-term observation system of the condition of marine ecosystems and species. Our study proposes the establishment of a new marine biodiversity monitoring program (MBMP) focusing on three MPAs of the Mexican Caribbean. Five conservation objects (COs) were defined (coral reefs, seagrass beds, mangroves, marine turtles, and sharks-rays) for their ecological relevance and the pressures they are facing. Coral reef, seagrass and mangroves have multiple biological, biogeochemical and physical interactions. Marine turtles are listed as endangered species, and the status of their populations is unknown in the marine area of the MPAs. Elasmobranchs play a key role as top and medium predators, and their populations have been poorly studied. Indicators were proposed for monitoring each CO. As a technological innovation, all information obtained from the MBMP will be uploaded to the Coastal Marine Information and Analysis System (SIMAR), a public, user-friendly and interactive web platform that allows for automatic data management and processing.\",\n",
              " \"In recent decades, the commodification of the English language has aroused intensive research interest in the sociolinguistics on a global scale, but studies on the commodification of the Chinese language are relatively rare. Most studies take a critical approach in relation to its adverse impacts on minority rights and social justice. This study examined the language landscape in Chiangmai, Thailand, and the linguistic beliefs of local Thai Chinese language learners. Based on their feedback, this study investigated the commodification of Chinese language education in the community of Chinese language learners in Chiangmai. We found that from a less critical perspective, the commodification of a second language provides more accessible and affordable educational opportunities for learners, especially those from low-income families, and at the same time language proficiency can broaden learners' career choices and provide employees with additional value in industries, such as tourism, commerce, and services. This finding implies that language commodification, rather than typically being associated with linguistic imperialism and unbalanced socio-economic status, can be a contributing factor in promoting higher-education availability and social sustainability in certain circumstances. There may be some mediating factors between the commodification of language and changes in the sustainable balance of language, opening up space for future research to explore.\",\n",

Building on previously developed place-making models, this study focuses on how a well-accessed and linked heritage site can be modelled and evaluated via Space Syntax measures to improve the quality of tourists' spatial experience. As the use of space syntax was found to be a useful technique for analysing tourists' itineraries and the factors that affect it; This study uses it to suggest the most appropriate pedestrian walkway given the various constraints of the existing historic fabric and to identify multiple measures of a destination's assessment. These measures have been noted in the previously developed models. The adopted measures that address access & linkage parameters include connectivity, integration, choice, and legibility. The findings explain that the adoption of access & linkage parameters contribute to revitalising the place in the sense of connecting the entire heritage site and enhancing the visitors experience.\",\n",

The analysis covers the years 2005-2018. The dependent variable is the volume of municipal waste in kg per capita, whereas the group of determinants include: economic and human development, uncontrolled dumping sites, population density, population at the working age, migration, tourism, urbanization, dwellings and housing, retail sales, entities, education, and investments in waste management. The geographically weighted regression with spatial error term (GWR-SEM) was employed in this study. The model enabled not only the specification of the waste production determinants, but also the analysis of the variability in the strength and direction of dependencies occurring between the examined variables in individual communes. The results proved that the higher the level of education, the less waste is generated (in north-central Poland); the business entities and working-age population are crucial for the waste quantity in communes of eastern Poland; the factors most important to regional range affecting the waste quantity are urban and business development, and most important to strength are higher education and the share of working-age individuals.\",\n",

However, studies that report such age-based generalizations tend to neglect the phenomenon of intragenerational variability in social media use, providing an oversimplified picture of how people behave. Moreover, studies that compare social media use across nations are lacking, and are also needed to establish the generality of this phenomenon. This paper investigates intragenerational variability in social media sharing among Millennial travelers in six nations (Canada, France, India, Japan, Mexico, and USA) using Destination Canadas Global Tourism Watch database. A latent class segmentation model is used to identify groups of travelers with different ways of using social media to share trip experiences. Results supported five unique classes of social media sharing, ranging from nonuse to highly integrated sharing across many platforms. Additionally, class membership is predicted by covariates (nationality, travel experience, and social media use and goals) and is predictive of destination advocacy (offering recommendations). The identification of different classes of social media sharing advances theory on intragenerational and cross-national variability, and informs the development of international strategies that target Millennial travelers based on their tendency to share and advocate.',\n",
              " \"Grassland ecosystems support well-being with food, shelter, income, and culture of herdsmen. While the association between ecosystem services and human well-being has been widely studied, such association is understudied in grassland ecosystems. This study aims to fill this gap through a case study of Xilinhot City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China. We examined the association between grassland provisioning services and herdsmen's well-being between 1985 and 2015 through participatory observations, interviews, surveys, and Bayesian belief network modeling. Considering the uncertainties of weather and sheep prices, we developed four scenarios to examine the future well-being of herdsmen. Our results show that the most important factor for herdsmen's well-being was income, which is highly sensitive to the market price of sheep and precipitation. Considering the uncertainties of sheep prices and precipitation, scenario analysis revealed a divergence between income and well-being. While herdsmen's income is most likely to increase with low precipitation and increased sheep prices, their well-being is most likely to improve with abundant precipitation and increased sheep prices. Based on our findings, we argue that developing alternative income sources (e.g., tourism), reducing dependence on government subsidies through commercial insurance, and branding lamb with grassland ecosystem to alleviate the impact of price fluctuations would help improve herdsmen's well-being in all scenarios.\",\n",
              " \"The article presents geospatial analysis supporting Systematic Conservation Planning approach based on viewshed assessment, aiming to identify strategic observation points with a lower degree of redundancy along a visitor trail. By means of the viewshed technique in a Geography Information System (GIS), the observer's fields of view were mapped (viewshed) to 17 points along a trail located in Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park - Brazil. Panoramic photographs were obtained for the same points, representing the field of view of a tourist. Through field of view analysis of the 17 areas, the technique of overlapping viewshed models identified four strategic points to contemplate the landscape, due to the lower degree of redundancy. As a result, it was noticed that although covering only 57% of the visible area of the trail, the visible regions of the four points are the most representative (higher regions, distant from each other). Also, their areas of visibility are little redundant and complementary, which ratified the efficiency described in the Systematic Conservation Planning (SCP). The results of this research can provide guidance for the visual landscape interpretation of the whole trail, and not just the waterfalls, located at the end of the course. In addition, this locational analysis can collaborate in the tourism management by addressing the demand points destined to be the targets of future installation of information panels or observation towers.\",\n",
              " \"Due to the outstanding growth of geotagging technology usage among the social networking sites (SNSs) users, research is needed to better understand how SNSs users accept and use this technology. This study explores the factors that affect the adoption of geotagging technology among the SNSs users integrating personal innovativeness in IT (PIIT) with UTAUT. By using structured questionnaire survey, 390 data were collected. Statistical analysis techniques, such as SPSS AMOS and partial least square method, based on structural equation modelling (SEM), were used to analyse the collected data. Integrated UTAUT fulfills all criterion of model fitness. Interestingly, PIIT properly explains the personal characteristics of SNSs users in UTAUT framework. PIIT has impact on all UTAUT exogenous constructs except effort expectancy as well as on behavioural intention. Two new paths among the predictor variables (e.g. facilitating condition to effort expectancy and effort expectancy to performance expectancy) are statistically significant. All constructs of UTAUT except effort expectancy have substantial positive effect on SNSs users' intention to adopt geotagging technology. Geotagg's use frequency strongly moderated the different relationships in the integrated UTAUT model. The study will succor different tourism firms, restaurants and SNSs service providers to maximise the adoption of geotagging technology use. It contributes to knowledge by adding new moderator, new paths as well as integrating personal characteristics (e.g. PIIT) in UTAUT.\",\n",
              " \"This study investigated the awareness of residents who had not yet begun long-stay tourism undertakings in rural area in Japan, to understand their basic intentions concerning agricultural and rural-experience exchange business, farm-stay business, and receiving foreign tourists. The factors that influence the intentions are defined based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A survey questionnaire was employed to collect data from the residents in three communities in the Murakumo area of Tambasasayama City. A structural equation model (SEM) was used to analyze the level of the factors' influence on the residents' intentions. With regard to the residents' intentions toward the three types of business, a large proportion of residents tended to hold negative attitudes. Residents almost held more negative attitude to farm-stay business and receiving foreigners than to carry out agricultural and rural-experience exchange businesses. There existed significant differences in intentions according to gender, and the intentions of males were stronger than females. In the analysis of influence factors, the factor of attitude had a significant positive effect on residents' concerns about rural-exchange experience businesses, farm-stay businesses, and receiving foreign tourists. The factor of perceived behavioral control only had a significant positive effect on the concerns about receiving foreign tourists. The subjective norm had no significant relationship to residents' intentions.\",\n",
              " 'The Yalahau region, located in the northeastern portion of the Yucatan Peninsula, hosts a series of elongated depressions trending north/south in the direction of Isla Holbox, identified as the Holbox Fracture Zone. Previous studies have explored the geomorphology and various hydrologic characteristics of the Yucatan Peninsula; however, there is a paucity of data concerning the interior region where the fractures are located. Strontium isotope ratios and major ion geochemistry data of the surface water and groundwater of this region serve as a hydrogeochemical fingerprint, aiding in constraining the hydrological boundaries, determining flow paths, and characterizing hydrogeochemical processes that impact the composition of the groundwater within the region. 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios indicate a different signature than the surrounding bedrock Sr ratio, suggesting that the flow throughout the Yalahau region is moving through channels faster than that of much of the Yucatan. Through major ion geochemistry and 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios, we were able to delineate at least two flow paths within the Yalahau region and identify a point of saline intrusion at least 35 km from the coast. Gaining an understanding of the hydrogeochemistry and water flow regions is crucial in determining the impact of various activities (e.g., extensive tourism, drinking water withdrawal, wastewater discharge/injection) that occur within the Yucatan Peninsula.',\n",
              " 'This paper aimed at analyzing the spatial distribution and variation of agricultural heritage systems (AHSs) in China. In particular, the spatial relationships between AHS sites and influencing factors were analyzed by employing a spatial analysis approach, i.e., solving for cause-effect relations. Then, two reasonable pathways for protecting AHSs were proposed following this methodology. The results showed that the number of AHS sites in eastern China was larger than in western China. This peculiar distribution is thought to be affected by distinctive natural resource endowments and sociocultural traits of local agricultural systems. Indeed, a series of natural, sociocultural, and economic factors were analyzed to reveal their relationships with AHSs. In China, AHS sites have excellent and unique natural conditions, and their clustered distributions positively correlate with the spatial distribution of high-quality agricultural products and the biological abundance index; on the other hand, they negatively correlate with the relief degree of the land surface and GDP. Further results showed that regions with AHSs were mainly located in rural areas of major Chinese cultural zones. In conclusion, two pathways of implementation of high-quality agricultural products and agro-tourism were proposed in order to play an integrated economic, social, and ecological function for protecting AHSs in China. These scientific findings may encourage local governments to protect AHSs and the transition of rural communities.',\n",
              " 'Pleasant climates can be divided into two types: the comfortable summer climate and the comfortable winter climate, but existing studies rarely pay attention to the distribution characteristics and differences between the two types of climate. This study investigates the spatial distribution of comfortable summer and winter climates in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and their differences based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-interim) reanalysis data from 1979 to 2018. The Universal Thermal Climate Index was used to analyze climatic suitability. The findings are as follows. First, the comfortable summer climate regions of the CPEC were mainly distributed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and some regions of Xinjiang in China and also sporadically distributed in high altitude mountains, such as the western plateau area. The comfortable winter climate regions were mainly distributed in vast areas except for Karakoram and nearby areas. Second, there are a few regions with dual attributes of comfortable summer and winter climates in CPEC. Third, according to the calculation and comparison of the regional area of different climate comfort levels in summer and winter, it is found that the comfortable summer climate is scarcer in CPEC and is a monopoly resource. The comfortable winter climate is widely distributed, belonging to the ubiquitous resources. These findings can be helpful for the tourism development of local climate resources.',\n",

I focus on abazunguzayi, nomadic merchants whose public presence in Kigalis streets are seen as antithetical to the global city aesthetics that urban managers wish to stamp on Kigali as its future image. I argue that abazunguzayi shift the weight of authority from formalized sources to the streets by leveraging an internal contradiction of transforming Kigalis surface into an optimally controlled high-tech city with world-class infrastructure municipal aspirations to produce Kigalis future as a hub of high-end tourism and international conferences ironically depend on the very subjects and practices that are considered antithetical to that future. I argue that this is occurring for two reasons. First, Kigalis street economy is embedded in the daily operations of the city. Abazunguzayi run discount economies that the citys low-paid workforce depends on to reproduce their labor. This includes the labor that is necessary to build the envisioned new Kigali. Second, while everyone participates in the street economy, women abazunguzayi pose a specific problem for city authorities. As crackdowns on the street trade are becoming more violent and visibly target women, city authorities undermine the national project to promote womens empowerment as an element of Rwandas world-class brand.',\n",

Throughout the citys history, which spans more than 400years, geodiversity has always been present since the early days of local cartography, dating back to the Dutch occupation period, on the seventeenth century, in which the natural environment had been faithfully portrayed. The studies developed in this work approach the geodiversity of Natal City that occurs naturally, in situ. The identification of the main places in which the abiotic nature is highlighted was performed, allied to a geological-geomorphological description. The occurrences were classified according to their area extension and the ecosystem services of abiotic nature, in a system divided into five services (cultural, regulating, provisioning, supporting, and knowledge). In the study area, all services were identified, and of the subclassification in geodiversity goods and processes, 16 out of 25 were observed, which reaffirms the importance of the local abiotic nature. On the tipology of these occurrences, they were identified as sections, areas, point, and viewpoints. Due to its extension and variety, it can be used for science, culture, sports, and tourism, in order to promote, jointly, the dissemination of the natural and cultural beauties of the city and geosciences, helping the geoconservation process.',\n",

Quantifying the contribution to coastal economies enables policy makers to plan for the sustainable development of these activities and consider trade-offs resulting from the implementation of regulations. Highlighting the importance of MRF enables their integration into fisheries management plans, tourism, and coastal infrastructure strategies, yet these effects are rarely quantified. In this study, the economic contribution of charter boat sea angling on coastal communities was assessed for four ports in Dorset on the South coast of England (Poole, Swanage, Weymouth and Portland). Poole and Weymouth have the largest charter fleets in the UK. Valuations from Poole and Swanage, as well as Weymouth and Portland were used alongside the numbers of boats in the fleet to estimate a cumulative economic impact to Dorset from charter boat activity of 2.4 million in gross output and providing about 3.6 million in estimated economic contribution and over 1.3 million of Gross Value Added (GVA). Future fisheries management should consider impacts and benefits when developing strategies for MRF, potentially distinguishing between different parts of the sector. This is particularly important for the charter fleet, as they are small businesses that rely on the value they generate to operate as businesses rather than being a pure recreational activity.',\n",

The increasing number of confirmed cases during the quarantine period of Diamond Princess questioned the efficiency and science behind the Japanese government's emergency management of the outbreak and led to a debate on the responsibilities of the ship's country of registry and port country. In order to deal with the spread of virus on a cruise ship rationally, the present study analyses why cruise ships are more prone to an emergent epidemic and discusses requirements of international conventions and domestic laws on cruise ship sanitation and epidemic prevention. It also evaluates the rescue responsibility of Flag State and Port State, explores the legal lacunae of international conventions on the rescue obligation of cruise home port, and provides solutions for prevention and control of cruise ship epidemic with short-term response measures and long-term mechanism construction. In terms of a short-term response, it is vital to adopt the quarantine idea of a temporary cabin hospital and a disposal procedure of circular disinfection-section repeat testing-batch transfer and quarantine-international collaborative medical treatment. For a long-term mechanism construction, three aspects need to be considered: the risk emergency management mechanism of cruise lines, health and epidemic prevention supervision mechanisms, and international cooperation mechanisms of infectious disease prevention.\",\n",
              " 'The integration of indigenous viewpoints in Ecosystem Service frameworks and planning processes are often lacking, necessitating a need to integrate diverse perspectives for knowledge coproduction. The study adopts a comparative analysis to explore local perceptions of the diversity of forest ecosystem services and values for ecological restoration among urban and rural Vhavenda groups in the Vhembe District of South Africa. We apply the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES) framework to structure ecosystem services to explore how well indigenous perspectives are represented. Rural populations identified the provisioning services of forests as more important compared to urban populations to support subsistence lifestyles with a higher dependence on natural resources. Rural values for ecological restoration were dominated by biocultural restoration objectives to revive indigenous knowledge and local practices and inter-generational learning experiences. Trade-offs exist among urban groups where forests are valued for employment and tourism and rural groups where intangible values are associated with the spiritual importance of sacred forests. However, commonalities between rural and urban residents persist with collective objectives to restore biodiversity and ecosystem services, enhance collaborations between stakeholders and stimulate education experiences that draw on indigenous and scientific knowledge of forest ecosystems. Our study points to the challenges of ecosystem service valuation and considers the importance of integrating stakeholder values for informing deliberative decision-making.',\n",
              " 'Cities have always been hubs for celebration and festivity, bringing people together to escape temporarily from the mundane nature of everyday routines. Festivals have often been bridges between people and places, linking personal geography with collective experiences and therefore increasingly of interest to cultural geographers. However, festivals also have social, economic and political aspects that are constructed by societal influences of the time and place. This article presents some of the key debates ongoing in academic literature across disciplines to demonstrate the contested role that cultural festivals play in urban settings and suggests that urban geography is critical to developing these debates. It is simply no longer possible to say that festivity is a simple rupture in the mundanity of everyday life of urban citizens; rather, contemporary cultural festivals now often exhibit complex and uneasy tensions between the socio-economic strategies of commercialized neoliberal cities and the cultural needs of diverse communities to gather and celebrate. By reviewing the development of festivals as part of the urban cultural economy utilising a geographic lens, this article sets out how cultural festivals are now more often employed by cities for marketing, tourism and other socio-economic benefits. We demonstrate that cultural festivals and cities have an ongoing relationship, which is now mainly commercialized and politicized, and this has diverse impacts on communities, urban spaces and cultural identities.',\n",
              " 'In the last decade, the city of Delhi has witnessed a surge in urban artistic practice  particularly street art  that draws its conceptual and art-historical virtue from being in the public sphere. The changing socio-economic, infrastructural and aesthetic set-up of the city bears many similarities to what has been called the cultural regeneration of cities across the globe. Interpreting it as symptomatic of the neo-liberalization of the Indian city, this article examines the spatial implications of the burgeoning contemporary street art movement in Delhi. It contextual-izes the art movement within place-making initiatives in Indian cities that have been attempting to attract the middle-class to city spaces to cater to their consumption patterns. The article suggests that there are two ways in which commissioned street art in neoliberal Delhi closely ties up with the neoliberal agenda of uneven redevelopment and regeneration in the city: (a) by instrumentalizing its form to revitalize decrepit areas that need capital investment in order to garner cultural tourism and trigger capital investment; and (b) by invoking a narrative of beautification and cleanliness that has been seen to emerge from a dominantly middle-class perspective in Indian cities. Looking at the unique ways in which urban space in Delhi interacts with local-political situations and responds to such place-making initiatives, the article attempts to interrogate what art-led gentrification implies in the economic and sociopolitical context of cities of the global South.',\n",
              " 'The objective of the research is to analyze the behavior of social indicators for the labor market of tourist services in Mato Grosso do Sul. For this, the methodology used was: Social Assessment of the Life Cycle-LCA, in which it constitutes a new internationally recognized approach to social research on the production of products and services. It is observed that the advantage in the use of LCA is the possibility of studying specific stages in the life cycle of a given product or service or its entire productive chain. The analysis period was between 2006 and 2015, using secondary data on formal employment, obtained from the Annual List of Social Information and Social Security. The indicators selected for use were extracted from UNEP / SETAP (2009; 2011). Among the research findings, it can be observed that the behavior on the existence of wage differences between men and women was maintained, a common situation in the country. When considering that Mato Grosso do Sul borders with other countries like Paraguay, there was a need to know if there are wage differences as well, between Brazilians and non-Brazilians, the results indicate that there are differences. In addition, there was a reduction in unionized employees in the activities studied and the risk of work activities increased during the analysis period. Thus, it is believed that there is a need for investment in tourism sector enterprises, in activities that contribute to improvements for employees, as a measure of social responsibility.',\n",

Despite the massive popularity of social media, the studies with a comprehensive set of driving constructs along with indicators of social media regarding the changing behavior of tourists are lacking in the literature. Therefore, framed by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), the present study fulfills this research gap by developing a set of driving constructs and carrying out an empirical analysis by collecting data from millennials in the selected universities of the Czech Republic. Through the non-random sampling technique, precisely convenience sampling, 261 valid responses were received, and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) analysis was performed to achieve the objectives of this study. The results indicate that social media channels have a significant impact on behavioral intention and the actual behavior of tourists (significant direct and indirect effect). The constructs tourist information search and tourism promotion were partially supported toward predicting the behavior of tourists. Control-variables related to socio-economic characteristics such as gender and educational level also have a significant impact in determining the actual behavior of tourists. Hence, overall, the study concludes with the significant and considerable impact of social media on the behavior of tourists. The contributions of the study and future directions are discussed at the end of the paper.',\n",
              " \"Effective protection of biodiversity in areas of high conservation value requires trade-offs between local use of natural resources and conservation restrictions. The compromise is often difficult to reach, which causes conflicts over the management priorities of existing and potential protected areas. Ecosystem services (ES) perspective offers a promising avenue for diagnosing and reconciling contrasting interests concerning the use of benefits from ecosystems. We examined how the spatial proximity to the Biaowiea Forest (BF), a European biodiversity hotspot, affects the perceived use of ES by local communities. We performed a survey among 719 respondents from 35 villages situated within BF and in its vicinity. We found that both the declared use of ES and the perceived influence of ES on household's economy was declining with the distance from BF with particularly high differences between areas not further than 3 km from BF and areas located 3-15 km from BF. Different zones varied in terms of benefits from tourism and costs connected with a potential limited access to ES due to conservation. Broadening the perspective, we argue that the trade-offs linked to ES may vary depending on the location in relation to the protected area and that local communities should not be treated as a homogenous group when considering benefits from the forest. Awareness of common patterns of ES use over space and local specificity may enhance effective management of even highly contested conservation areas.\",\n",
              " \"The New Chinese Cinemas were unprecedented in critiquing official narratives of progress through dramatic location-shot images of rural Taiwan and China. Much more than standing in as a picturesque backdrop, the rural was a site of complex ideological contestations. Yet, existing scholarship overlooks the richness of rural representations, reductively interpreting rural films as works of nostalgia and cultural salvage. Through a comparative analysis of representations of landscape, travel and visual perception in Hou Hsiao-Hsien's Dust in the Wind (1986) and Jia Zhangke's Platform (2000), this article brings into focus the important but largely ignored roles that Hou and Jia have played in envisioning new frameworks for thinking about rural geographies. Drawing from Doreen Massey's notion of the 'progressive place', I investigate how Jiufen and Fenyang - the films' shooting locations - are stages upon which the directors experimented with imaging and imagining communities. Jiufen is represented in Dust as a porous interface between the urban and rural, a metonym for the film's representation of Taiwan as a contact zone with China. Platform, by contrast, fashions an image of Fenyang as a non-place, a microcosm of China as it undergoes unchecked neo-liberal development. Significantly, these films went beyond revising rural imaginaries on-screen, to making a material impact on Jiufen and Fenyang by transforming them into landmarks of global film tourism. This work demonstrates how Hou and Jia responded to disorienting social changes not by resisting, but by tactically embracing the blurring of divides between the urban and rural, and local and global.\",\n",

It is unique and original at the world level for a protected area to retain in a single perimeter these three major ecosystems, which therefore gives this national park an exceptional quality. Khnefiss national park faces numerous natural, human-induced, institutional, organizational, and legal constraints. Hence, there is a need for a practical tool that would reconcile the imperatives of conservation, the demands of the local population, and tourism, and at the same time positively address the constraints that hamper the management of this geosite. Indeed, we will highlight a reflection that aims at clarifying the sense of this new trajectory in which Morocco is positioned in terms of interest development of geological heritage, the emergence of consumption of natural assets, and potentialities phenomenon according to regions.

The study area has for many decades been classified as a marginal and problem region, mainly due to a substantial trend of long-term depopulation. However, in recent years the signs of economic revival have been observed. The study innovatively uses the functional typology of the smallest administrative units (villages) to recognize the character and spatial differentiation of functional transformations of these localities in the last 15 years following Polish accession to the European Union. The analyses were based on the data from the National Official Business Register. The results show an increase in the number of villages with dominant service functions, especially in tourism, and decrease in numbers of villages with the dominant agricultural sector. These changes can be interpreted as an illustration of evolutionary multifunctional rural development in marginal areas, which also affects villages previously classified as declining. The findings allow for proposing a new category of a reviving village. Significant spatial differentiation of functional changes in the problem region suggests that local conditions exert a considerable influence on the course and scale of transformation in rural areas. Effectively, problem area is a heterogeneous category. Therefore there is a vital need for in-depth analyses, including new typologies, of the smallest administrative units (villages), to capture current processes in rural areas and to adapt strategies, support, and development policies to local assets and site-specific needs.',\n",
              " 'This study explores the reconfiguration of land politics in a poor rural area of Ghana following the development of a community-based resource management and market-based conservation initiative. In particular we focus on an eco-tourism site that was developed through the Avu Lagoon Community Resource Management Area (CREMA) in Ghana. We adopt a political ecology approach that combines qualitative and quantitative information from multiple sources to explain the nature, drivers and outcomes of this reconfiguration of land politics. In particular we track how different environmental and socioeconomic narratives were mobilized and utilised to justify the establishment of the Avu Lagoon CREMA, and how this gave rise to a series of unmet expectations. The restriction of access to fertile land fit for sugarcane production (a key livelihood activity in the area), combined with the underperformance of the ecotourism project, led to different land contestations, including illicit land transfers and silent repossession through encroachment. We synthesize the main findings through the theory of access and argue that these dynamics follow the reconfiguration of land access, and are reflections of the weak enforcement of CREMA regulations, elite capture of the process, and a lack of proper benefit-sharing mechanisms. From a policy perspective, it is important to give due attention to community participation, payment of compensation, proper benefit-sharing mechanisms and the balance of power between local elites, external organisations and the local communities. Only then would CREMA processes be able to deliver their dual objectives of biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic development.',\n",

In this study, to critically assess the effects of a tsunami on the District of Tofino on Vancouver Island, British Columbia, tsunami simulations were performed. As a result of tsunami propagation and inundation simulations, it was found that for earthquakes Mw9.0 or greater, the central part of the Esowista Peninsula on which Tofino is located will be completely inundated. The authors have also conducted tsunami evacuation simulations using an agent-based model developed by Takabatake et al. (2017). This evacuation model considered Tofino's large fluctuation in residents due to seasonal tourism in a number of selected scenarios. Using the model, the authors also conducted a sensitivity analysis to investigate effects of the change in evacuation behaviour on the mortality rate. The results showed that a significant number of casualties would occur in Tofino, especially if an earthquake was to occur at night. It was also shown to be important to consider the capacity of evacuation buildings when directing evacuees, especially the elderly. In addition, the present study clarified that the effects of evacuation start time and route choices on the mortality rate would vary significantly according to a population distribution scenario even in the same study area. It was thus highlighted that conducting sensitivity analysis under varied population distribution scenarios is important to understand properly the uncertainty associated with tsunami evacuation.\",\n",

This is done primarily in the context of recreational habits, emotional responses and social engagement, thus combining multiple facets of event experience within one study in the milieu of twenty-first century house music. The EEMM used a questionnaire to garner broad themes associated with this event type; this produced an Experience Matrix which can then be completed by an individual to produce an individual Experience Map. Key to this principle is that this map this will differ from person to person and thus the EEMM allows for this to be expressed in an individual map. The map demonstrates the intersections of four aspects of experience and thus plots which aspects are more/ less prevalent within that individuals experience.',\n",

A well-designed and well-managed booking website can satisfy the tourists needs, whereas a less intuitive one can make them dissatisfied. The search engine developers cannot develop an effective and efficient booking website which satisfies the users needs, creates a favorable experience for them, and influences their intention to purchase, without understanding the users needs regarding the search engines attributes and features. This study applies a quantitative research, collects primary data, and investigates how booking websites can move from a basic to a sophisticated online presence. The aim of the analysis is to provide an insight regarding the tourists preferences and their interface needs, as well as the filters and the options that may help them find the most relevant results for the chosen destinations. The study develops a comprehensive performance evaluation model for booking websites using specific attributes and features of the tourism industry. This model includes usability and functionality dimensions that have been identified by analyzing six booking websites, three used at the international level (Booking, Priceline, and Hotwire) and three used only in Romania (Vola, Infoturism, and Carta), and correlated with the customers needs regarding booking websites and hotel website evaluation. The results are useful for booking website developers and can be used to adapt their user interfaces, making them far more user-friendly. Suggestions are made regarding how to improve the performance of booking websites and potential ways for future research are discussed.',\n",

Advocates of these markets for virtue sought to supplant the insatiable hedonic impulse with a morally restrained, self-disciplining disposition to consumption. With moral markets currently losing their appeal, we respond to the tendency to view hedonism as an inhibitor of moral market behaviour, and view it instead as a potential enabler. Drawing upon the concept of alternative hedonism (Soper, J Consum Cult 7:205229, 2007; Cult Stud 22(5):567587, 2008; Ethics and morality in consumption: interdisciplinary perspectives, Routledge, London, 2016; A new hedonism: a post-consumerism vision, the next system project, 2017), we illustrate how consumers experience both morality and pleasure concurrently; show how they attempt to reconcile these aspects of the experience and elucidate the implications of doing so. Using the moral market for ethical tourism as an exemplar of alternative hedonism, we identify three self-managing strategiesmoderating, abiding and levellingthat re-structure the moral order of consumption in meaningful ways and with profound outcomes. In the context of anxieties about personal, social and ecological consequences of consumption, we show empirically how self-managing strategies reify a less contradictory framing of consumption by tapping into alternative cultural discourses on morality. We discuss the consequences of these strategies, highlighting how they may legitimise and sustain consumption via moral markets despite the reproduction of social inequality and ecological threats.',\n",

For years Tourism Flanders has marketed Flanders abroad as a destination for experiencing this unique cycling race. The agency opts for a knowledge-driven approach and therefore conducts research on cycling enthusiasts abroad. This is a challenge because it is not easy to efficiently reach a sufficiently large sample via traditional recruiting methods, such as online panels or face-to-face recruitment. That is why alternative research methods are being developed. This contribution examines two big-data-based studies. The first study targets those who are passionate about cycling on a global scale. This research is based on Facebook data. The considerable size of these anonymised data makes it possible to define and analyse the group of cycling enthusiasts against a reference group. By working with two different reference groups, on the one hand, we gain a picture of the typical global cycling enthusiast and, on the other hand, we can discern whether there are differences within the global group of cycling enthusiasts, for example by country of origin. The second study uses Strava app data to bring the foreign cycling tourist in Flanders to the fore. Amateur cyclists use this app to measure, track, and share their performances. This entails a wealth of information which is analysed in this contribution. The first study thus offers a picture of the potential international visitor and the second a picture of the international visitor who comes to experience Flemish cycling heritage.',\n",
              " 'Establishing sustainable and responsible speleotourism development is a major challenge and involves complex activities. Adequate theoretical starting point is the application of geoethical values related to the conservation and protection of the caves to be used for touristic purposes. Positive and negative cases of human behaviors towards speleological geoheritage are discussed, in order to highlight what should be done in cave management to avoid malpractices and on what elements could be founded adequate strategies aimed at promoting sustainable speleotourism. This is important to tourism management organizations involved in the promotion of caves and in creating economic opportunities for local populations, while respecting cave ecosystems. Modern cave management must be focused on the protection of the cave ecosystems, finding ways to achieve at the same time an economic development of local communities. But this approach needs the adoption of a geoethical framework of values to be shared by all stakeholders involved so that successful cooperation can be achieved despite differences in interests and expectations. The aim of this paper is to raise the awareness about the need to apply the values of geoethics to speleotourism, stimulating new fields of discussion within the scientific and technical communities involved in studies and activities related to geotourism and geoheritage. The possibilities of developing new ways to manage caves, in order to promote a sustainable socio-economic development of local communities, have to be balanced with the protection of natural environments as much as possible. The proposed theoretical frameworks have the goal to increase the discussion on the best ways of connecting speleotourism to sustainable and responsible cave management, presenting two case studies, and pointing out potential solutions.',\n",
              " 'The uniqueness of the spits comes from their special coastal geomorphology. Spits evolution is controlled by the fragile environmental conditions, the sediment input, long shore currents, wave, wind and river processes. The Kzkumu Spit, one of the attractive examples (400 m long; 1848 m wide) is located in an environmentally protected area in southwestern Turkey (Data-Marmaris). Extending 50 cm below the sea as a red carpet, the spit with its distinctive appearance and mysterious history enhance the sites attractiveness which brings on the possible anthropogenic effects as overpopulation during summer tourism and the lower sediment influx from improper marine structure. This study characterizes the spit formation via recent and the past satellite images, geological and topographical maps to better figure out the protection pathways. Six locations were defined and twelve beach sediments in total were sampled. The particle size distribution by sieving together with micro-imaging the sediments are combined with the statistical analyses. Mode values from sieve analysis and the red-coloured sediments along the coast which are also visible on satellite images point out that the Kzkumu Spit is fed from north (via Kocapnar Stream Delta and its coast) and east (via Bozeri Brook). An uncontrolled sand-drawing from the coast, establishing the breakwaters to prevent the longshore currents and waves onto the coastal structures and experiencing walking along the spit, all cause the dispersion of the sediments and very intense erosion on the spit. The results of this study suggest that immediate protection measures (including spit-monitoring, prevention of sand drawing, limitation of daily tourist activities) should be taken for future sustainability of the Kzkumu spit.',\n",
              " 'Mountainous highways suffer from high crash rates and fatality rates in many countries, and single-vehicle crashes are overrepresented along mountainous highways. Route familiarity has been found greatly associated with driver behaviour and traffic safety. This study aimed to investigate and compare the contributory factors that significantly influence the injury severities of the familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. Based on 3037 cases of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes from 2015 to 2017, the characteristics related to crash, environment, vehicle and driver are included. Random-effects generalized ordered probit (REGOP) models were applied to model injury severities of familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers that are involved in the single-vehicle crashes on the mountainous highways, given that the single-vehicle crashes had occurred. The results of REGOP models showed that 8 of the studied factors are found to be significantly associated with the injury severities of the familiar drivers, and 10 of the studied factors are found to significantly influence the injury severities of unfamiliar drivers. These research results suggest that there is a large difference of significant factors contributing to the injury severities between familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers. The results shed light on both the similar and different causes of high injury severities for familiar and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. These research results can help develop effective countermeasures and proper policies for familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers targetedly on the mountainous highways and alleviate injury severities of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes to some extent. Based on the results of this study, some potential countermeasures can be proposed to minimize the risk of single-vehicle crashes on different mountainous highways, including tourism highways with a large number of unfamiliar drivers and other normal mountainous highways with more familiar drivers.',\n",
              " 'This study systematically reviews 146 publications on the socio-economic importance of natural and planted walnut forests in the 15 countries of the Silk Road in order to comprehensively assess the current state of knowledge, identify knowledge gaps and define priorities for further research. Despite widely spreading natural and cultivated walnut forests along the Silk Road, which are intensively utilized and make significant contribution to local livelihoods, we found that existing socio-economic research was still relatively limited and unequally distributed among the Silk Road countries, especially for Central Asia and Iran. As evidenced by the significant decline of walnut forests and their continued degradation, past forest conservation policies and programs were often not effective and, therefore, novel strategies and implementation models are urgently needed to achieve sustainable forest management objectives. Our review has shown that conducive economic policies, well-funded national walnut breeding programs and economic incentive schemes could effectively promote the establishment of walnut plantations, which both considerably contribute to the reclamation and rehabilitation of degraded lands and the diversification of farming systems. At the same time, further efforts are needed in walnut research and practice to improve existing value chain arrangements, develop novel products from J. regia and other underutilized forest species, and to more effectively monitor resources and enforce existing legal frameworks. While country-level research gaps seem often to be driven by national agendas and donor interests, we also identified more general topics that did not have received appropriate attention in the literature across all the investigated countries. This includes research on the impact and effectiveness of walnut plantations in reducing pressure on natural walnut forests under land sparing strategies; investigations on the role alternative forms of tourism can play in walnut forest conservation and development; and consumer studies that can provide useful guidance to enterprises in the food processing, cosmetics, handicraft and other industries to improve the quality, value-added and profitability of products derived from the walnut forests. These points illustrate the need for more systematic studies in the walnut forests of the Silk Road countries.',\n",

              " \"The Arctic is facing rapid and significant social, cultural, economic and environmental changes. In recent years, due to ongoing and forecasted climate change impacts, policymakers' and the research community's interest in the region has increased dramatically within and outside of Arctic countries. This is reflected in increasing public visibility and in the amount of attention the Arctic region has gained in the media. In parallel, tourism in the Arctic has undergone considerable growth and the Arctic is emerging as a popular destination, although tourism in the Arctic has existed for over two centuries. Nevertheless, Arctic tourism is a concept that has been substantially used in academic literature, policy documents, and tourism promotion materials, although there is no current consensus on its definition. The term, often taken for granted, generally refers to tourism in and about the Arctic, wherein the Arctic is characterized by static and external views, overlooking its rich diversity in terms of cultures, landscapes, climates and environments. In this study, my interest is in the (re)conceptualization of Arctic tourism, based on studies about tourist experiences at the Arctic Circle in Rovaniemi, the capital of Finnish Lapland. This thesis contributes to literature on tourist experiences in the Arctic, a topic that has not received a lot of attention in the past, but one that has significant relevance in terms of tourists' decision-making in response to Arctic communities' efforts to attract visitors and stimulate regional tourism development. By addressing tourist experiences and border literature, this study also contributes to conceptual discussions on Arctic tourism. This dissertation focuses on the Arctic Circle both as a tourist attraction and as a border for the Arctic region. It aims to shed light on tourists' practices and experiences of the Arctic in Rovaniemi and to understand 'how Arctic' this important destination is. The chosen case study did not consist of a simple location, but of a specific ritual performed and reproduced by tourists: the crossing of the Arctic Circle. In the tourism industry, Arctic Circle landmarks are commonly represented as gateways to the Arctic, and crossing the line signifies entering the region. As such, this particular performance crystallizes tourists' representations of the Arctic. This study aims to investigate these crystalized representations and is based on empirical materials consisting of qualitative data gathered from multiple ethnographies and secondary materials comprising academic literature, policy documents and promotional tourism materials. Traditional on-site ethnography was conducted through methods inspired by participant observation at different Arctic Circle landmarks located in Rovaniemi. Netnography was aimed at investigating post-trip experiences of crossing the Arctic Circle as reported on Instagram, and autoethnography was used for the purpose of self-reflection related to my Arctic experiences as a tourist. Qualitative data were analyzed from an interpretative approach, and especially using hermeneutics, in order to understand the meanings behind Instagram posts and specific postures when crossing the Arctic Circle. The results indicate that in Rovaniemi, from the tourist perspective, the Arctic is experienced as a nebulous region with no proper boundaries. Tourists do not perceive the Arctic Circle as an absolute border for the Arctic, despite heavy promotion and the performance of border-crossing postures. Rather, the magical line is considered as one of the many items encompassed by the vague representation of what the Arctic is. Other elements like the presence of snow, reindeer and northern lights are also all part of what a full Arctic experience is supposed to be. This suggests that, from the tourist perspective, proper Arctic experiences should be winter-based, which is the foundation for the 'cryospheric gaze' developed in this thesis as the definition for current Arctic tourism. The cryospheric gaze, grounded in Urry's tourist gaze, is also supported by how the Santa Claus tourism industry, highly present in Rovaniemi, extracts and exploits winter-based elements of the Arctic for its own promotion and development. In order to acknowledge the diversity of the Arctic, I argue for a fluidity in space and time of the tourism segment called Arctic tourism. Toward the end of the thesis, the future of Arctic tourism is discussed in relation to climate change and the development of 'post-Arctic regions'. It explores challenges in terms of equal access to snow, of stereotypical images of the Arctic becoming burdensome for local communities and how current forms of Arctic tourism can still be offered to tourists in 'cryosphericless' regions that have built themselves into Arctic tourism destinations.\",\n",
              " 'This paper aims to investigate the opinions of local cheese producers with regard to the relationships between cheese and tourism in rural areas. Based on a case study approach, data was collected through semi-structured interviews with cheesemakers and visits to cheesemaking facilities in Valle de Roncal (Roncal valley), a mountain region in northern Spain. Results of this research show that cheese producers in rural areas award tourism value to cheese by appreciating its historical linkages to land and landscapes, the rural lifestyle, and a regional communication of cheese. The originality of this paper lies on the approach to a niche tourism which is drawn from the understanding of cheese as both a local product and a tourist attraction, from the perspective of local producers in peripheries. This research informs rural tourism planners in the design of (food) tourist experiences that rely on a local-based storytelling.',\n",
              " 'Purpose: Rural homestays have emerged as an interesting option for tourists. This study aims to assess the role of destination attractiveness factors and travel motivations in homestay choice. The moderating role of need for uniqueness towards enhancing these relationships is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: A survey of 201 Indian tourists who had visited rural homestays in the Uttarakhand state of India was conducted. Data were analyzed using SPSS and WarpPLS, based on structural equation modelling approach. Findings: Results indicate that two destination attractiveness factors  (a) cultural and rural attractions and (b) destination location and transportation  have a significant association with rural homestay choice. Further, need for uniqueness enhances the relationship between natural attractions and choosing rural homestays. Originality/value: Although there are several studies on rural homestays, there is scant research on the factors influencing the choice of rural homestays from a tourists perspective. Besides, studies on rural homestay tourism have not assessed the role of need for uniqueness in influencing such choices. The implications of the study for destination marketers, homestay operators and owners are discussed which would hopefully aid in attracting discerning tourists to the rural homestays to such regions.',\n",
              " 'The growth of urban tourism has received wide attentions from tourism geography. Over the past four decades, China has been witnessed rapid, continuous and non-limit growths of urban tourism in most cities. The local governments and developers were encouraged by this miracle of past growth expectation or plan to a more optimistic glowing future. However, the urban tourism is an open and high mobility subsystem of city system, and its growth is stable and faces limits from both supply and demand sides for a certain period. When tourist demand exceeds its supply, it will lead to overtourism. Oppositely, when tourism supply exceeds tourist demand, which will result in over tourismification. The growth of urban tourism demand curve is stepped. Only when the long-term influencing factors of urban tourist demand continue to undergo major changes, can the growth of urban tourism break through the original limit and enter a new stage. The limit of urban tourist demand stipulates the urban tourism supply and determines the scale and level of tourist facilities such as scenic spots, hotels, restaurants, and shopping mall which are cater to the need of urban tourists within a certain period. This study defines a phenomenon of over tourismification as the status of tourism supply over tourist demand, which is manifested as three conditions: whole over-supply, partial over-supply and no over-supply but facing negative reaction to tourism growth by enterprises and locals. This study also proposes an analytical framework on limits to growth of urban tourism and uses it to empirically analyze urban tourism of Zhuhai city. It is found that middle- and high-end tourist demand of the study city has been stable and faced limit since less constant change in function, status, features and image of Zhuhai city took place and more intense competition from surrounding cities occurred in the past decade. This indicated that the supply of middle- and high-end hotels and other tourist facilities in Zhuhai reached a saturation point and any new more such tourist facilities will make for over tourismification. The conditions of breaking through limit and the relationship between growth of urban tourism and tourism development were discussed and suggestions on the improvement of tourism statistics in China were also proposed.',\n",
              " 'The spatial difference between regional tourism efficiency and tourism scale is evident. It is of great theoretical and practical value to dynamically grasp the spatial-temporal evolution characteristics and the coupling coordination relationship of them to promote the high-quality sustainable development of tourism. This paper measures the tourism scale of 126 city units in the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2001 to 2018. The DEA-MI model was introduced to measure and decompose tourism efficiency, while the exploratory spatio-temporal data analysis method was used to explore the spatial and temporal characteristics of regional tourism differences and spatial structure. In addition, the coupling coordination degree model of tourism efficiency and scale was established to examine the coupling superiority and synergy consistency of the two. The results demonstrated the following: (1) the spatial difference in comprehensive tourism efficiency of the study area was recognizable. The average situation exhibited the spatial distribution characteristics of \"high in the east and west and low in the middle\", and inter-annual changes decline in fluctuations. Scale efficiency played a supporting role in overall efficiency, and technical efficiency played a restrictive role. (2) The fluctuation range with the local spatial structure of tourism efficiency and tourism scale was relatively small, and the direction of dependence was relatively stable. The volatility of the latter is slightly stronger than that of the former, and the change of spatial dependence direction is comparable. The competitive situation of local spatial structure of tourism efficiency was stronger than that of cooperation, and the integration of tourism scale cooperation was strong. (3) The local spatial structure of tourism scale was relatively stable as it was was difficult to change the relative position of the city unit. However, the local spatial structure of tourism efficiency was still unstable, and it was likely to change the possibility within the city unit. (4) The overall coupling degree and coupling coordination degree of tourism efficiency and scale were gradually improved with similar spatial and temporal differentiation characteristics. There was spatial heterogeneity and volatility in local evolution, and the high value region of the degree of coupling coordination generated a broader range and slower diffusion.',\n",
              " 'Ritual has become an excellent field for space research and theoretical interpretation due to its symbolic and social nature. In the research of ritual and ritual space, the social relationship behind ritual and its impact on ritual space have not been fully taken into account. This study takes Tunpu Dixi and Bamabadian as examples, using the method of interview, observation and literature analysis, to trace back and analyze the process and characteristics of two ritual space productions, describe the social relations that participate in and influence the ritual space production, deeply analyze each dimension of ritual space and the ternary interactive practice of space production, and try to compare and present the impact of tourism development on the changes of local traditional rituals. The study found that the traditional ritual space is shaped by the social relations of the ritual subjects, and its space production is essentially a process of \"restructuring or debugging\" social relations and spatial order. In the ritual space production under the influence of tourism, the differentiated interactive relationship between the spatial representation and the representational space creates the differentiated ritual space practice. In addition, the ritual space production implies the resistance to the dissolution of modernity. This study builds a theoretical framework for traditional ritual space production, and provides a new perspective for interpreting and deepening Lefebvre\\'s space ternary interaction, in order to reveal the deeper connection between tourism and local cultural changes.',\n",

In the analysis, preference for cruise ports in East Asia is also examined. Design/methodology/approach: The behavioral model of potential cruiser is developed through a mixed ordered logit approach. The data are collected by means of the stated preference method with the application of a Web-based questionnaire. Multiple answers are collected from each respondent. Hence, panel effects between answers are considered so as to obtain a robust model. Findings: The results show that Nagasaki and Hong Kong ports are preferred, and other domestic ports, namely, Kobe, Kagoshima, and Naha are also relatively popular places to visit. However, potential Japanese cruisers are reluctant to visit two South Korean destinations which are frequently selected as cruise lines by avoiding Cabotage rule. Besides, shorter cruise duration and lower prices increase the possibility of participation in cruise tourism, particularly for working people. Retirees tend to have less interest in cruise tourism. However, Japanese-related services will increase retirees intentions to participate in cruise tourism. Research limitations/implications: This study attempts to analyze potential cruisers behavior toward cruise ship tourism in Japan and discusses how to increase the number of cruisers participating in cruise ship tourism. In this vein, repeat behavior should also be analyzed. Repeat behavior contributes to the maintenance and increase in cruisers in Japan. Originality/value: There is no study on potential cruisers behavior analysis in Japan which is the emerging country as cruise market. Thus, the number of potential cruisers is expected to be high. This study reveals that potential cruisers preferences on cruise ship services (e.g. duration, price, on board services, etc.), which are separately analysed for working ages and retirees. Besides, preferences on port of calls in East Asian context are revealed. These results are useful for cruise ship industries, especially for cruise lines.',\n",

In addition, the city has a rich traditional gastronomic resource base, belonging to over 16 nationalities living in the Vojvodina area (Autonomous Province of Serbia). This study aims to analyze the impact of Instagram, on the choice of catering facility and type of food, and to discover the extent to which it creates confidence to gastronomic consumers and the brand of the product or service. Design/methodology/approach: The study presents a survey, which involves sharing survey questionnaires and gathering information from research participants. The sample of the survey included only the local population during 2019 year, on a random sample of 155 participants. Findings: Of the total number of respondents, the highest percentage of them follow Instagram posts related to gastronomic objects, compared to other social networks. The results of this study undoubtedly show that consumers have great confidence in this social network and that it creates a certain brand and attitude on the basis of which consumers will choose a catering facility or food. Practical implications: The process of interviewing people in gastronomy, regarding the impact of social networks on brand, attitude and consumer confidence, can provide an excellent insight into the current situation as well as influence changes that would contribute to better business of restaurant facilities in Serbia. Social implications: Doing survey research is much more significant in the field of tourism and gastronomy, as these are industries that are primarily the human sector. The personal attitude of the direct users of the services in the restaurant facilities can contribute to the overall picture of the state of gastronomy in this area. Originality/value: The study contributes to the development of contemporary gastronomy, which is on the rise compared to many other branches of the economy in Serbia.

We present a payments for ecosystem services (PES) design process with multi-criteria analysis (MCA) based evaluation of alternatives within a nature-based tourism area in northern Finland. The tourism activities are located on private lands, which are mainly managed for timber production, negatively affecting landscape and recreational values. Earlier attempts have not catalysed the required action among local actors. To increase the practical operability of the suggested PES an MCA process was organised with stakeholders. Alternative PES systems, meeting the demands of local conditions also in the future, were evaluated against good governance criteria in future scenarios. Then, SWOT analysis was carried out for the preferred alternative to reveal supporting and hindering factors for the uptake of the suggested system. The alternative that is obligatory for visitors to the area was preferred among stakeholders representing foresters and tourism entrepreneurs due to its cost-efficiency and funding base. Its implementation would still require a practically adoptable definition of the PES scheme and new co-management arrangements among the actors operating in the area. ; 2019 Newcastle University.',\n",

The proposed model was examined using partial least squares, and the model fits, composite reliability and convergent validity were assessed. The direction and significance of the relationships were determined by testing all of the hypotheses. Findings: The results showed that there was a positive effect of using QR codes. However, the study showed that a QR code cannot completely affect the overall satisfaction at a destination.

Little attention is paid to its impact on tourism from the perspective of tourist generating places. In this study, the authors, by employing Structure Equation Modelling and taking Beijing as the case, have examined severe smogs impact on tourism. It is found that (1) Beijing residents have a strong perception of the negative impacts of smog, and there existed significant group differences in their perception by demographic attributes; (2) Severe smog plays dual roles in stimulating more travel demand. On the one hand, it can strengthen the push force; on the other hand, it makes those clean-air destinations have stronger pull force; (3) impacts of severe smog on tourism should be regarded dialectically. It does bring forth perceivable negative impact on the image of travel destination. However, from the perspective of tourist generating place, it can stimulate more travel demand and therefore can play a positive role in promoting tourism development in its neighboured places with good air quality.',\n",

The covariance-based structural equation modelling (CB-SEM) analysis was conducted to test the studys hypotheses. Findings: The community's attitudes and personal benefits were identified to strongly influence communitys support towards the conservation and development of the World Heritage Sites in George Town. While a small number of community members acknowledged the significant opportunities through tourism, majority of them expected economic and non-economic benefits from the development of World Heritage Sites. Practical implications: The findings from this study are expected to contribute to the ongoing debate on the perceived effects, benefits and future support of the World Heritage Sites from the local community's perspectives. Social implications: Understanding the behaviour of the local community to create successful tourism planning, especially in delicate heritage destinations. Originality/value: This study enriches the scarce empirical research study on communitys behaviour living in the vicinity of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, especially in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region.\",\n",
              " \"Staging Indigenous Heritage examines the cultural politics of four Indigenous cultural villages in Malaysia. Demonstrating that such villages are often beset with the politics of brokerage and representation, the book shows that this reinforces a culture of dependency on the brokers. By critically examining the relationship between Indigenous tourism and development through the establishment of Indigenous cultural villages, the book addresses the complexities of adopting the 'culture for development' paradigm as a developmental strategy. Demonstrating that the opportunities for self-representation and self-determination can become entwined with the politics of brokerage and the contradictory dualism of culture, it becomes clear that this can both facilitate and compromise their intended outcomes. Challenging the simplistic conceptualisation of Indigenous communities as harmonious and unified wholes, the book shows how Indigenous cultures are actively forged, struggled over, and negotiated in contemporary Malaysia. Confronting the largely positive rhetoric in current discourses on the benefits of community-based cultural projects, Staging Indigenous Heritage should be essential reading for academics and students in the fields of museum studies, cultural heritage studies, Indigenous studies, development studies, tourism, anthropology, and geography. The book should also be of interest to museum and heritage professionals around the world.\",\n",
              " 'Tourism and recreation in protected areas may compromise conservation values if their forms and volumes exceed the areas tolerance. Disturbance-sensitive species such as wild and semi-domestic reindeer (Rangifer tarandus tarandus) in most mountain areas in Fennoscandia are particularly vulnerable to humans, but disturbance research seldom includes data on the human component of this co-existence. By estimating the visitor volume in space and time and visitor characteristics in the largest national park and wild reindeer range in Norway we analyzed reindeer trail crossing propensity and examined the spatial overlap between humans and GPS-collared female reindeer (n = 98) during summer. The data showed that female reindeer herds used areas with overall less human traffic and recreational infrastructure. Reindeer herds started avoiding crossing hiking trails used by more than 1015 persons per day and avoided crossing trails when visitor volumes exceeded 3050 persons per day. During the hunting season, the herds were largely dispersed and crossed over trails independent of visitor volume, indicating a collective flight response to hunters. We discuss how including data on human use can further our understanding of ecological effects in disturbance research and how it can improve management interventions for better co-existence between humans and reindeer.',\n",
              " 'Purpose: The main purpose of the study is to determine international leisure tourist perceptions with regard to crime, to assess the influence of demographic factors and to investigate the influence of prior, during and post-visit measures on international leisure tourists crime perceptions. Design/methodology/approach: A personal intercept interview survey was used to collect the data at popular Cape Town (CT) tourist attractions via structured questionnaires. A generalized linear model was used to statistically assess respondents crime-related perceptions. Qualitative data was also generated via individual in-depth interviews, which were conducted among nine international leisure tourists. Findings: The study found that international leisure tourists exhibited favorable sentiments regarding crime preparations; general safety information; post-visit crime related perceptions but were less positive about security safety information during their visit. International leisure tourists maintained that crime did not inhibit their activities and was not worse than anticipated during their visit. A majority of tourists indicated that they were not deterred by crime and would revisit CT. Research limitations/implications: The research was limited to a single city and to English-speaking international leisure tourists. The study was cross sectional in nature and the number of data collection sites was limited to four of the popular tourist attractions in CT. Practical implications: The study showed that a relatively high number of international leisure tourists had either witnessed or experienced crime in CT. Hence, a separate South African Police Service tourism protection unit could be established to help circumvent crime in CT. Originality/value: The study used both quantitative and qualitative approaches to provide a comprehensive overview of international leisure tourist crime perceptions, which included prior, during and post-visit measures, of one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Additionally, this study is one of the few recent endeavors to assess the influence of a broad range of demographic and crime-related factors on international leisure tourists prior, during and post-visit crime perceptions in an African developing country.',\n",

I argue for an interpretation of the Garden that accounts for the ways in which Christian engagements with the problem of presence accumulate promises of presence: the expectation, anticipation, and potentiality that a desired spiritual intimacy will be actualised. In particular, I highlight the devotional labour of custodians and visitors as integral for defining, narrating, and maintaining this promise.',\n",

An historical perspective shows how interests in food and leisure have evolved from early twentieth-century conspicuous consumption, to food destinations, and celebrations. The hospitality industry frequently presents food as something contemporary, yet often with references to the past. Extensive media coverage and digital access to information have contributed to the high profile of food as a leisure activity. This is contrasted with early twentieth-century guidebooks which through text encouraged the consumption of food as leisure. Such developments are evident in the growth of food consumed at the destination, and brought home as a gift. Period guidebooks, travel journals, and postcards are utilized to show how food was of interest to consumers in the early twentieth century.

The Denpasar, Badung, Gianyar, and Tabanan (Sarbagita) areas experience the most rapid growth of tourism activity in Bali. This rapid tourism growth has caused land use and land cover (LULC) to change drastically. This study mapped the land-use change in Bali from 2000 to 2025. The land change modeller (LCM) tool in ArcGIS was employed to conduct this analysis. The images were classified into agricultural land, open area, mangrove, vegetation/forest, and built-up area. Some Landsat images in 2000 and 2015 were exploited in predicting the land use and land cover (LULC) change in 2019 and 2025. To measure the accuracy of prediction, Landsat 8 OLI images for 2019 were classified and tested to verify the LULC model for 2019. The Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network was trained with two influencing factors: elevation and road network. The result showed that the built-up growth direction expanded from the Denpasar area to the neighbouring areas, and land was converted from agriculture, open area and vegetation/forest to built-up for all observation years. The built-up was predicted growing up to 43 % from 2015 to 2025. This model could support decision-makers in issuing a policy for monitoring LULC since the Kappa coefficients were more than 80% for all models.',\n",

              " 'Japan has many meandering rivers in her mountainous areas. Many hazards have occurred in their surroundings. Airborne laser scanning (ALS) is one of measures for disaster prevention in the surrounding of a meandering river. In Japan, ordinary ALS by using both a fixed wing airplane and a rotary wing airplane adopts flying along straight lines over a target area. Although ALS along straight lines is effective when a target area is planar, ALS along straight lines for a meandering river in a mountainous area increases the number of flying courses and flight time. On the other hand, although ALS by a meandering flight along a target meandering river would be efficient in data acquisition, it depends on the skill of a pilot and brings difficulty in data processing to secure measuring accuracy. We decided to develop a new efficient ALS method by a meandering flight. It systematizes flight planning, GCP allocation, and data processing especially course adjustment to secure required measuring accuracy. After conducting preliminary experiments in the test area, measuring accuracy was verified following the operation guidelines for the Japanese public surveying established by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism of Japan.

A suitable mapping study method for analyzing and structuring a broad research field concerning methods, designs and research focuses on the existing publications. In total, 137 articles published during 20062019 in reliable academic databases such as Science Direct, Emerald, Scopus, Wiley, ProQuest, Sage, Web of Science and Taylor and Francis were selected and analyzed. Findings: The results show a rising trend of published articles in tourism, with the maximum number published in 2019 and the minimum number in 2006. Also, analysis of input articles revealed that most of the studies focused on the antecedents and prerequisites for co-creation and paid less attention to the co-creation context.

The analysis was based on interviews with twelve informants and stakeholders in tourism development collected in Kumamoto in summer 2018. The results suggest that the tourism industry contributes differently across the phases of a disaster but is mainly significant in terms of information provisions, communications and emergency accommodations for tourists. More fundamental changes may be observed in the long-term recovery and resolution phases, whereby tourism is most important in information collection, experience learning in disaster, institutional reform and strategy of sustainable tourism development and poster-disaster destination marketing.

              " 'This paper examines the non-linear effect of tourism on environmental degradation in 31 African countries. It also determines the moderating effect of tourism on the impact of economic growth on environmental degradation. It employs Pedroni, Johansen-Fisher and Westerlund panel cointegration tests to investigate the cointegration relationship between the variables. It uses the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares, dynamic system Generalized Method of Moments and Augmented Mean Group. These techniques enable us to account for various economic and econometric issues such as cointegration, heterogeneity, endogeneity, dynamism and cross-sectional dependence. This study reveals a cointegration relationship between the variables. It shows that tourism has a U-shaped non-linear effect on environmental degradation in African countries. Specifically, at early stage, tourism diminishes environmental degradation, but aggravates it as tourism increases. Besides, this study shows that tourism adversely moderates the impact of economic growth on environmental degradation. This paper makes significant contributions to the extant literature by unveiling the non-linear and moderating effects of tourism on the environment. The implication is that tourism is a significant determinant of environmental degradation, hence, effort to mitigate it should incorporate tourism.

That said, the aim of this study is to formulate a model that incorporates emotional solidarity and theory of planned behavior constructs to gauge residents behavioral intentions to support tourism. To test proposed model relationships between emotional solidarity, attitudinal support for tourism, perceived behavioral control, subjective norms, and behavioral intentions to support, data was collected from 740 residents of the widely-popular Mediterranean destination, Izmir (Turkey), and analyzed via structural equation modelling. Results revealed that each of the six proposed hypotheses were supported in the theoretical model. The three factors of emotional solidarity (i.e., welcoming nature, sympathetic understanding, and emotional closeness) uniquely explained 45% (R2 SMC = 0.45) of the variance in attitudinal support for tourism. In turn, attitudinal support, along with perceived behavioral control and subjective norms, explained 42% (R2 SMC = 0.42) of the variance in behavioral intentions to support tourism within Izmir.

On reflection, it is essentially not tourism, but the mechanisms underlying destination development process that lead to the changes. However, very few studies have explored these mechanisms with the majority of work simply comparing the pre- and post-tourism stages to conclude the effects of tourism on destinations. The current study builds on Lefebvres social space production epistemology to establish a conceptual framework to decipher the mechanisms. It was illustrated using the context of the Muslim community in Sanya, Hainan Province, China. Results demonstrate that the dynamic relationship between capital, culture and power initiated the production of the community space. Capital facilitated the production of spatial practices, which interacted with the representations of space dominated by the (administrative) power and the representational space produced by the Muslim culture.

The findings illustrate that consumers participating in online environmental discussion forums feel varying degrees of guilt and personal responsibility in relation to the negative impacts of tourism, with most keen to make environmentally friendly travel decisions. Despite these good intentions, however, it seems a range of barriers hinder the adoption of environmentally-responsible behaviours.

We evaluated a network of private and public reservesthe Greater Kruger National Park (GKNP)comparing economic contributions of member reserves while also attributing a range of values in financial, social and political domains to different components of the system, thus enabling integration of results with resilience-oriented management frameworks and decision-making processes. We show that the diversity of management units corresponds with a diversity of values that we argue underpins institutional resilience. Although private reserves constitute only 12% of the land area, visitor spending there is responsible for over 60% of employment, tax and GDP contributions. The national park is less commercialized but accounts for almost all domestic visits by maintaining affordable access, performing a vital political and social function.

Data from 519 Chinese tourists indicated that intrinsic religiosity positively and directly affected tourists pro-environmental behavioral intention in hotels, while extrinsic religiosity had no significant direct effect. Intrinsic religiosity and extrinsic religiosity both indirectly affected pro-environmental behavioral intention via frugality consciousness and connectedness to nature. In addition, the impact of intrinsic and extrinsic religiosity on tourists pro-environmental behavioral intention was contingent on environmental concern, which positively moderated the relationships among them. This research contributed to the pro-environmental behavior literature by providing a deeper understanding of how and when religiosity affects tourists pro-environmental behavioral intention in hotels. ; 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.',\n",

              " \"In studies of the impact of tourism, considerable attention has been given to the attitudes and perceptions of host communities toward tourism. However, most of these studies have focused on tourism in general and on sporadic alternative tourism in particular. This study aims to fill a gap in the research literature by examining residents' perceptions of the economic, socio-cultural, and environmental sustainability of edu-tourism. It contributes to the limited literature on edu-tourism and to that on residents' perceptions of tourism in small island developing states. A sample of 300 (N = 300) residents was surveyed in the city of Famagusta in Northern Cyprus to investigate residents' attitudes toward the sustainability of edu-tourism. ANOVA and Cramr's V tests were applied to analyze the perceptions of residents of the social, economic, and environmental impacts of edu-tourism. The influence of the socio-demographic characteristics of the residents on their perceptions and attitudes was of these issues was also examined. The study revealed that there is a variety of attitudes among residents toward the sustainability of edu-tourism and that, although residents are generally positive about edu-tourism, attitudes toward its social and environmental sustainability are mixed.\",\n",
              " 'Slum tourism as a topic of investigation has seen significant growth since the beginning of this decade with increasing theoretical and empirical depth. With this growth, some inconsistencies in conceptual framing and use of terminology have emerged. The purpose of this paper is to argue for township tourism in Soweto to be regarded as a form of heritage tourism rather than slum tourisma notion which has entered the township tourism literature in recent years. This argument is presented through two sections of analysis and debate, using Vilakazi precinct in Soweto as a case study. Firstly, the paper analyses the emergence of township tourism as an academic focus in the literature and how it came to be classified as slum tourism, considering definitional conundrums. Various South African authors emphasise the struggle heritage character of township tourism. Secondly, the historical development of townships and tourism in these areas are interrogated. The empirical data offer the perspectives on tourism in their area from: (a) residents living in and around Vilakazi Street; and (b) tourists visiting the Vilakazi precinct. The analysis reveals that neither residents nor visitors consider the Vilakazi precinct or the larger area of Orlando West as a slum; rather they perceive tourism is the area to be connected to its struggle heritage. We accordingly stress that the term slum tourism to describe township tourism in Soweto is inaccurate and is inconsistent with the views not only of residents and visitors, but also South African authors.',\n",
              " 'The COVID-19 pandemic will exert a devastating and destructive impact on the South African tourism economy with its ramifications felt countrywide. Nevertheless, the negative local impacts of the pandemic will be particularly harsh for those parts of South Africa where tourism is a critical sector in the local economy. The objective in this article is to identify the tourism spaces of vulnerability in South Africa. Use is made of the IHS Global Insight data base for 2016 to analyse at a local authority scale the most vulnerable localities to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Indicators used to isolate tourism spaces of vulnerability are total tourism spend; tourism spend as a proportion of local GDP; domestic and international tourism (trips and bednights); and, leisure, business and VFR (visiting friends and relatives) travel. The analysis discloses those local authorities that are the most vulnerable to the downturn/collapse of tourism as a whole as well as to the hollowing out of specific forms of tourism, namely domestic as opposed to international travel, leisure as opposed to business or VFR travel.',\n",
              " 'Sustainability studies in tourism are increasingly emphasizing social matters, for instance, \"Accessible Tourism for All.\" Research on people with visual impairments with smart tourism has so far been sparse. In order to resonate with the global call for sustainable tourism development, this paper aims to contribute to understanding the aspirations of people with visual impairments in terms of tourism and to explore how smart tourism destinations could potentially enhance the tourism experience they offer. We utilized multisensory participant observations and interviews to empathize with the target users and gain insights into their needs. The results showed that they were generally positive about travel, particularly autonomy, achievement needs, and socializing with other individuals. The findings also shed light on their desire to play games on their phones. Consequently, based on the findings and the theoretical groundings of PERMA model and MDA framework from positive psychology and game design, the study proposed a gamified approach to future tourism app design for people with visual impairments, which could enhance engagement, motivation, and enjoyment in the tourism experience.',\n",
              " \"In recent years, rural tourism has become a hot topic in the academia. Many researchers have proposed to alleviate the poverty of farmers and revitalize rural areas through rural tourism. This paper fully quantifies the tourism environmental carrying capacity (TECC) of Diaoshuihu National Forest Park (DNFP), and evaluates the current status of rural tourism near the scenic spot. Four criteria were selected according to the actual situation of the scenic spot. The TECC of the DNFP was evaluated by Pascal's Principle and then through analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Based on the evaluation results, several suggestions were put forward to promote the scenic spot-based rural tourism in and around the DNFP. The results show that the TECC of the DNFP was 6,160 persons, the annual TECC was 985,600 person/year, indicating that the scenic spot is under weak load. The local government is advised to optimize the design and implementation of DNFP-based rural tourism from four aspects: enhancing the integration between scenic spot and nearby villages, rationalizing the income distribution system, training talents for scenic spot-based rural tourism, and stepping up government guidance on rural tourism. The research results provide a reference for similar cases of scenic spot-driven rural tourism.\",\n",
              " \"This study examines the degree of macroeconomic recovery of the Nepal tourism industry after a natural disaster using the autoregressive integrated moving average model (ARIMA). The study investigated the case of Nepal's earthquakes in 2015 and examined the impact of the earthquakes on tourism inflows and GDP using time series data from 1990 to 2018. The results show that the increasing trend in the number of tourists changes in the post-earthquake period. In particular, the excess in tourist demand by age and purpose of visits after the earthquake indicates natural disaster as a potential reason for a tourism demand boost, often described as dark tourism in literature. This research shows the process of a heritage tourist destination assessing macroeconomic recovery from a natural disaster and fills the gap in the literature regarding purpose-based tourism demand and a link between dark tourism and disaster recovery on a heritage tourism destination.\",\n",
              " \"The rapid advancement of smart tourism technology brings new opportunities for tourism development. More travel destinations are relying on smart technology to attract more tourists to visit and enrich their travel experience. The main purpose of this study was to explore whether tourists are satisfied with their smart tourism technology experience (i.e., informativeness, accessibility, interactivity, personalization, and security). This study also investigated the impact of smart tourism technology experience on tourists' happiness and revisit intention. This study used a structural equation method to find the relationship among smart tourism technology attributes, travel satisfaction, happiness, and revisit intention. Surveys of a total of 527 participants who traveled to Macau from Mainland China were used for the analysis. The results showed that accessibility is the most important factor affecting the smart tourism technology experience and personalization the least. Smart tourism technology experience is shown to be significantly associated with travel experience satisfaction, and travel experience satisfaction has a positive effect on both tourists' happiness and revisit intention. Finally, tourist happiness is also shown to be positively associated with revisit intention. This study provides theoretical and practical significance for the development of smart tourism in the future.\",\n",
              " 'This study aims to examine the dynamic relationships among information and communication technologies (ICTs), international tourism, and terrorism in 28 countries from 1998 to 2016. Three weighted indices were constructed to gather the following factors: i) war against terrorism by military factors, ii) ICTs by different communication technologies, and iii) tourism demand by tourism factors. Results confirmed that the potential determinants of the war against terrorism include computer and communication services, secure Internet servers, per capita income, and trade openness. The key factors of ICT development are armed forces personnel, arms imports, military expenditures, per capita income, and trade openness, which can be effectively utilized for the war on terrorism across countries. Per capita income, trade, foreign direct investment inflows, and military expenditures substantially increased inbound tourism, whereas tourism demand increased computer and communication services, Internet users, and trade openness. Results also showed that armed forces personnel, arms imports, and growth-specific factors substantially increased tourism receipts, whereas high military expenditures decreased tourism income. These findings offer useful policy implications. One key conclusion drawn from this study is that ICTs play a potentially vital role in supporting the war against terrorism and the development of tourism across countries.',\n",
              " 'Olive oil tourism is an emerging activity that is sparking a growing interest among tourists seeking to partake in this experience and the self-fulfilment it offers. An ever-greater number of olive oil mills are diversifying their businesses to incorporate this type of tourism. In this article, olive oil tourism is characterized as a type of special interest tourism (SIT), under a demand-side approach. Based on quantitative research carried out with olive oil tourists, which examined the aspects of the destination they value, as well as their preferences and motivations for consumption, this article proposes four dimensions that are considered key for characterizing olive oil tourism as SIT: experience, sustainability awareness, the promotion of local culture, and the image of status and prestige held by the tourist. This proposal to characterize olive oil tourism as a type of SIT can contribute to the development of more effective and successful marketing strategies that orient olive oil tourism towards services that tourists value and demand. In turn, this will have an impact in terms of wealth creation for rural olive oil producing areas.',\n",

This paper examines the rank-size distribution, geographical dispersion,and growth ratesof tourism in Japanand studieswhether Zipf's and Gibrat's laws apply toJapan's tourist flows. This study is the first to analyze inbound tourism to Japan by country of origin. Our analysis reveals that both the ranks and the volumeofJapanese tourists are stable, while the numbers of tourists from other countries have higher growth rates and fluctuate in rank order. Based on our comparative analysis, we conclude that tourism fromSoutheast Asian countries will continue to grow, and there is room for improving the geographical dispersionof international tourists in Japan.

Findings indicate that limited human resources impede the level of adaptive capability engagement in micro-tourism firms, whereby operational level capabilities act as an antecedent to adaptive capabilities. Such adaptive capabilities, including market sensing capabilities and senior tourism alignment activities, are developed by OMs as a means of differentiating their respective firms from sectoral rivals in pursuit of niche market potential.

              " 'Social media have become increasingly popular. However, there has been little investigation on how to effectively mobilize this newly emerging tool to promote tourism in rural areas. The aims of this article are twofold. First, among social media, we explore the role of Twitter for tourism promotion, especially by focusing on the recovery process of tourism in a rural area affected by the huge earthquake and tsunami, Magnitude 9.0, which hit eastern Japan in March 2011. Second, to approach the first purpose, we compare two types of tourism: ordinary tourism and volunteer tourism. As to the latter, a massive number of volunteers came to these areas to help in the recovery work from the devastation such as removing debris and helping evacuees rehabilitate their lives in Iwate prefecture. We employed a text-mining method to find keywords used in the official Twitter account issued by the Iwate Prefectural government and time-series regression models to identify factors that promote the two types of tourism. Data were collected using official statistics on incoming numbers of ordinary tourists and volunteer tourists. Tweeted information was provided by Iwate Prefecture. The results revealed that, first, tweeted information on cultural and natural heritage had a positive relationship with the number of incoming tourists while information on disaster-related words had negative effects. In contrast, second, tweeted information on tourism resources worked negatively toward the number of volunteer tourists while that on rehabilitation/reconstruction and on volunteers worked positively. Consequently, it is important to design support measures that enable the local tourism sector to attract incoming tourists after a drop-in volunteer tourism as reconstruction of the disaster area progresses. In this context, our results suggest how to effectively utilize Twitter for this purpose.',\n",

This study, conducted in the remote resort of Eilat, explores whether these resident groups representations of and attachment to their place shape their intentional behavior toward tourism, and tests the explanatory ability of the two factors to account for potential differences in groups intentional behavior. Findings suggest that the relationships between: (a) place attachment and destination image, (b) place attachment and intention to recommend, and (c) between destination image and intention to recommend, vary across the two groups. The study contributes to tourism theory by empirically validating the role of image and attachment as antecedent of such differentiation. Additional implications to tourism theory and practice are discussed.',\n",

The objective of this paper was to apply an index capable of identify problems at the water-tourism interface, based on a spatial approach in GIS, meant to support the management of groundwater quality in tourist destinations. This index was applied to a tourist destination in northeastern Brazil, which uses groundwater to maintain its tourism infrastructure. The geographic phenomenon analyzed showed a spatial pattern between water use and tourism, with probable influences in hydrochemistry of groundwater. We suggest that the use of the propose index associated to GIS may be part of strategic planning efforts contemplating the interaction between tourism, urban management and water security, thus guaranteeing the infrastructure essential to strengthening the economy of a tourist destination.',\n",
              " \"The hasty practice of moving to foreign countries for high tech medical services is hinged on a diverse range of motivators of which developing countries like Nigeria can take advantage of. This paper explored the reasons behind Nigerian consumers' outbound medical tourism; identified the risk factors that give Nigerians concern over engaging in medical tourism; and determined the effect of cost of treatment on outbound medical tourism. Using a structured online questionnaire, data were obtained from a judgemental sample of 100 medical tourists. The data gathered were analysed using descriptive statistics and linear regression analysis. The findings showed that Nigerians undertake outbound medical tourism due to improper medical treatment in home country, infrastructural inadequacies, commensurate cost of treatment in destination countries and availability of qualified health service providers abroad. The three major risk factors include; lack of insurance coverage, cultural differences, and travel time/distance. Lastly, cost of treatment significantly and positively affects Nigerian patients' outbound medical tourism intention. The implication is that government and non-governmental agencies should aggressively develop medical facilities in the nation's tourism hub to meet up international standard and discourage medical outbound tourism.\",\n",
              " 'Universal accessibility implies that everybody has an equal chance to access anything, which should also apply to the tourism industry. The United Nations World Tourism Organisation has pleaded that tourism be open to all, despite any impairments. Universal accessibility is not always available to visually, intellectually, mobility, psychiatrically and learning impoverished persons. People with Disabilities are often denied tourist activity pleasures enjoyed by healthy persons. The obvious challenges include restriction of mobility, but few facilities are visually impaired-friendly, besides addressing the other impairments. The study question was to investigate whether hospitality staff are educated or trained to assist people with disabilities to enjoy fully the facilities offered to paying guests at places of accommodation. The study adopted a mixed methodology, following a cluster and convenient sampling framework, focussing on the Cape Winelands area of Cape Town, South Africa. The results indicate that hospitality staff are interested in receiving disability awareness training, but that essential appropriate training would benefit disabled travel as a market segment in South Africa. This study is of material importance to tourism organisations, such as Cape Town Tourism and Wesgro, in promoting tourism in one of the major destinations in world tourism.',\n",

This study reviews some archaeological studies in Igboland, document potential archaeotourism resources/sites in the area, and discusses the challenges and prospects of archaeotourism in Igboland in south-eastern Nigeria. Secondary sources and in-depth interviews were used to generate data. The archival study of archaeological studies in the area reveals Archaeotourism as a neglected tourism niche worthy of exploration by tourism stakeholders within the study area and beyond. It, however, offers mutual and collaborative benefits to archaeology and tourism scholars, income to host communities, government, and archaeology and tourism stakeholders. Although there are some limitations, these can be surmounted. The implication of the study is that archaeotourism designed to align with the socio-economic cum socio-cultural milieu of Igboland seems a probable path for sustainable archaeological heritage management in the 21st Century, and an opportunity to boost tourism.',\n",

              " 'This research aims at identifying the role of social media in evaluating the attractiveness of a tourism destination, with special emphasis on the health safety of the destination. Consistent with this objective, a survey has been carried out on a sample of 675 Romanian social media users. The research results led to the development of a model based on structural equation modeling. The model includes nine latent variables that were structured taking into account different behavioral aspects related to the role social media has in travel planning, as well as for evaluating the health safety of a tourism destination. The main findings suggest that the trust in social media for tourism information made people become more interested in communicating through this means and to consider it more useful throughout the travel planning process. When choosing a travel destination, the more involved a tourist is in the decision making process, the greater the attention they pay to social media. The perceived usefulness of social media in travel planning has a significant influence on intentions to choose a tourism destination. As the importance assigned to the health safety of tourism destination increases, social media plays a more active role in travel by creating trust in this means in order to obtain sanitary safety information. People that intend to use social media for finding information on the health safety of a tourism destination are more likely to choose that destination for their vacation. The managerial implications of this paper regard the communication strategies adopted by tourism services suppliers or by some public authorities aimed at stimulating an efficient usage of social media so as to increase the buying intentions for tourism destinations.',\n",

Thus, it examines the causal relationship between well-being measures (overall well-being, social well-being, health well-being, and material well-being), tourism, terrorism, and inequality by focusing on Pakistan as a case study. We applied several time series techniques and procedures that include the bounds test, autoregressive distributed lag model mechanism, and Granger causality to analyze the relationships between the aforementioned variables. The findings suggest significant positive relationships between tourism and well-being measures. However, terrorism has a significant negative effect on well-being measures. Inequalities in the distributions of income and facilities have substantial negative effects on well-being measures and tourism; besides, it shows a significant positive association with terrorism. This study indicates that through effective tourism planning, policy makers can improve well-being measures, hence, leading to a reduction in terrorism. However, along with progress in well-being dimensions, policies, and long-term planning should be developed to ensure the equal distribution of income and facilities.',\n",
              " 'Tourism is shaped by a wide range of factors and forces, including exogenous ones that have no direct link with the tourism sector. Natural disasters and unexpected events are prime examples of such determining factors, as they have profound effects on individuals and society, and as a result have the potential to affect tourism flows considerably. Several theoretical arguments exist why natural disasters and unexpected events could influence tourist destination choices. However, empirical research to confirm the nature and extent of impacts of disasters on tourism is lacking. To address this gap, this paper incorporates a dataset on natural and man-made disaster events into a model of international tourism flows to evaluate the effect of different types of disasters on international arrivals at the national level. Findings provide evidence that the occurrence of different types of event change tourist flows to varying degrees. Although in some cases a positive effect is estimated, in general the impacts are negative, resulting in reduced tourist arrivals following an event. Understanding the relationship between disaster events and tourism is helpful for destination managers who make critical decisions in relation to recovery, reconstruction and marketing.',\n",

The validity of the instruments used in our study were demonstrated in previous tourism and marketing studies. Specifically, three items were used for information authenticity. Three items were adopted to evaluate information sensation. Three items were used for star ratings. Three items were used to evaluate customer reviews. Finally, to evaluate involvement in the ELM, three items were adopted from prior studies. As for the constructs within TPB, three items were adopted to measure attitude; three items were used for subjective norms; three items were used to measure perceived behavior control; Finally, three items were used to estimate intention. All items used in our current study were measured by a Likert scale ranging from one to seven points (Table I). The items were translated into Chinese by bilingual individuals whose native language was Chinese. First, an independent translation was done by three individuals, and then, differences were addressed based on their discussion and agreement. The initial questionnaire was slightly modified and refined to better reflect the context of tourism by academic and industrial experts. The final version of the question comprised two screening questions about the date of recent travel experience and tourism LBS use, as well as pictures showing smartphone tourism LBS interfaces with a brief description.\\nData collection procedure\\nData collection lasted approximately one month, from June 7 to July 5 2018, using a snowball sampling method and an online questionnaire. The questionnaire was developed using professional survey-design software and a website link to the questionnaire was sent to the respondents via chatting programs through smartphones. Ten well-trained surveyors who were students in three universities in China sent the link to their classmates to expand the sample group to their acquaintances. To avoid a biased sample, we used a snowball technique. The importance of using the snowball technique is to select a representative sample (Baltar and Brunet, 2012). According to previous studies (Kim et al., 2015), active smartphone users were generally young, highly educated and more were female. In their research, possible reasons were cohort effects (higher adoption rates among young people) and the influence of lifestyle factors (highly educated individuals). Therefore, it is logical for us to use such a group as a representative sample to spread the questionnaire to their acquaintances by using snowball sampling. Meanwhile, to collect a sample representing China nationwide, we sent the questionnaire to the students based on their family addresses. Students from 23 provinces and autonomous regions in China were chosen, and therefore, represented a major part of China. In addition, the number of students in each province and autonomous region were decided based on its ratio to the national population. Initially, the questionnaire was distributed to 52 students. These students were required to finish the questionnaire to receive a small gift. However, before the students sent the questionnaire links to the potential respondents, a description of LBS and a screening question, “Have you used the LBS in the past month?” were presented. Only the subjects who had travel experience within the recent month and used tourism LBS functions during their trips were invited to the survey. Then, they were further rewarded with an online coupon if they sent the screened interface back, showing “You Have Finished the Questionnaire” back to the surveyors. Those who finished the questionnaires were also rewarded with online money coupons. As a result, a total of 412 questionnaires were completed. After dropping unusable responses, we kept 353 respondents in the final analysis.\\nData analysis\\nSPSS 18 and AMOS 21 were used to analyze the data. Specifically, we first used a confirmatory factor analysis with the method of maximum likelihood estimation. Next, we used structural equation modeling to examine causal relationships within the research model. Moreover, to confirm the superiority of the extended TPB, modeling comparisons were also carried out. Finally, to test the moderating effects of involvement, we compared the two models (low and low levels of involvement groups) by using χ2 differences with two degrees of freedom (Baron and Kenny, 1986).\\nDemographic profile\\nAmong the 353 respondents, 23.2 per cent of the tourists were male and 76.8 per cent were female. As for the age group, respondents between 21 and 30 years of age (60.4 per cent) accounted for the largest group, followed by the group younger than 20 years of age (18.4 per cent), the group between 31 and 40 years of age (11.9 per cent), the group between 41 and 50 years of age (8.2 per cent per cent) and the group older than 51 years of age (1.1 per cent). Of all respondents, 23.2 per cent were single and 76.8 per cent were married. A large proportion of individuals had a family income lower than 3,000 Chinese Yuan per month (52.1 per cent), followed by more than 9,001 Chinese Yuan per month (25.7 per cent) and between 3,001 and 9,000 Chinese Yuan per month (22.1 per cent). Regarding to respondents’ education level, most of them had a degree higher than bachelor’s (87.6 per cent). As indicated previously, app users were generally younger, educated and more were women (Kim et al., 2015), which means our sample generally represented LBS users.'"
