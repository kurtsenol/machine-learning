IT EXAMINES THE POTENTIAL SYNERGIES AND CHALLENGES FOR PLATFORMS TO ADD PIPELINE COMPONENTS AND VICE VERSA FOR PIPELINE BUSINESSES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH THIS PAPER USES A CONCEPTUAL APPROACH THAT SYNTHESIZES AND INTEGRATES THE LITERATURE FROM SERVICE, HOSPITALITY, AND STRATEGY, AND SUPPLEMENTS THEM WITH TWO ILLUSTRATIVE MINI-CASE STUDIES. FINDINGS WHILE THE EXTANT LITERATURE TYPICALLY FOCUSES ON THE DICHOTOMY BETWEEN INCUMBENT PIPELINE BUSINESSES THAT CREATE VALUE BY CONTROLLING A LINEAR SERIES OF ACTIVITIES AND NETWORK EFFECTS-DRIVEN PLATFORMS, WE DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TWO TYPES OF PLATFORM BUSINESS MODELS (I.E. PLATFORMS WITH ASSET CONTROL AND PLATFORMS WITH PEER-PROVIDED ASSETS).

WE LINK DEMOGRAPHIC AND ATTITUDINAL ANTECEDENTS TO THE RELATION BETWEEN SELF-INVESTMENT AND USE. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH DATA WERE COLLECTED TOGETHER WITH A BELGIAN MEDIA COMPANY (N = 4,136). TO TEST THE EFFECTS A LATENT GROWTH MODEL WAS COMPOSED IN A MULTIGROUP SETTING WITH GENDER AS THE GROUPING VARIABLE. THE MODEL IS ANALYZED THROUGH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING IN MPLUS 8.0. FINDINGS IN GENERAL, STRONG RELATIONS BETWEEN SELF-INVESTMENT AND INCREASED USE WERE FOUND, ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT OF SELF-INVESTMENT ON USE WAS STRONGER FOR FEMALE CONSUMERS. FURTHERMORE, WE ESTABLISHED STRONG HEDONIC EFFECTS ON USING AND INVESTING IN THE SERVICE. FOR MEN, EASY TO USE PLATFORMS LEAD TO LESS SELF-INVESTMENT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS OUR FINDINGS ARE RESTRICTED TO FREE SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, ATTITUDINAL VARIABLES ARE ANTECEDENTS OF BEHAVIORS. HOWEVER, A MORE COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL AND ATTITUDINAL VARIABLES IS POSSIBLE. FURTHER RESEARCH COULD USE REPEATEDLY MEASURED ATTITUDINAL MEASURES AND LINK THESE TO BEHAVIORS OVER TIME. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS SERVICE DEVELOPERS COULD OFFER DIFFERENT PLATFORM INTERACTIONS TO DIFFERENT SEGMENTS TO CREATE CONSUMER VALUE. WOMEN SEEM MORE RECEPTIVE FOR EXTRA FUNCTIONALITIES, SUCH AS THE POSSIBILITY TO INDICATE PREFERENCES. MEN MAINLY FOCUS ON THE CONTENT OFFERED. ORIGINALITY/VALUE THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON A NEW FORM OF MEDIA DISTRIBUTION, ONLINE TV CONTENT PLATFORMS, WHERE WE INVESTIGATE TWO RELATED BEHAVIORS OF USERS OVER TIME (SELF-INVESTMENT AND USE) INSTEAD OF A GENERAL APPROXIMATION OF USE.
